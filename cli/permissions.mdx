Every API key has a set of permissions that control which endpoints it can access. This page covers permission categories, how to build scoped keys, and how to manage team roles through the CLI.

For an overview of API key creation and setup, see [Authentication](/cli/authentication).

## Permission Categories

Permissions are organized into categories. When you create a scoped API key, you include only the categories the key needs:

| Category | Controls |
|----------|----------|
| `instance_read` | Viewing instances, logs, SSH keys, volumes, deposits |
| `instance_write` | Creating, managing, and destroying instances and volumes |
| `user_read` | Viewing account info, API keys, SSH keys, environment variables, templates |
| `user_write` | Creating/modifying API keys, SSH keys, environment variables, templates, teams |
| `billing_read` | Viewing invoices and earnings |
| `billing_write` | Transferring credit |
| `machine_read` | Viewing machines and reports (hosts) |
| `machine_write` | Managing machines, maintenance, listing/unlisting (hosts) |
| `misc` | Search offers, benchmarks, network volumes, serverless endpoints |
| `team_read` | Viewing team members and roles |
| `team_write` | Inviting/removing team members, managing roles |

For the complete mapping of which specific endpoints each category controls, see [Permissions (API)](/api-reference/permissions#endpoint-reference-by-category).

## Creating Scoped Keys

Define permissions as a JSON file. The top-level key is always `"api"`, containing the categories you want to grant:

```json
{
    "api": {
        "misc": {},
        "user_read": {},
        "instance_read": {},
        "instance_write": {}
    }
}
```

Save this as `perms.json`, then pass it to the CLI:

```bash
vastai create api-key --name "ci-deploy-key" --permission_file perms.json
```

## Constraints

Constraints narrow a permission category to specific parameter values. This lets you create keys that can only operate on certain resources.

### Constrain by Exact ID

This permissions file allows reading logs for instance 1227 only:

```json
{
    "api": {
        "instance_read": {
            "api.instance.request_logs": {
                "constraints": {
                    "id": {
                        "eq": 1227
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Constrain by Range

You can combine `gte` (greater than or equal) and `lte` (less than or equal) operators to define a range:

```json
{
    "api": {
        "instance_read": {
            "api.instance.request_logs": {
                "constraints": {
                    "id": {
                        "gte": 1,
                        "lte": 100
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Available constraint operators: `eq`, `gte`, `lte`.

<Warning>
Keys with constraints must be created through the CLI or API. The web console only creates full-access keys.

## Managing Team Roles

Team roles use the same permission model as API keys. You define permissions in a JSON file and pass it to the team role commands.

### Create a Role

```bash
vastai create team-role --name "developer" --permissions perms.json
```

### View Roles

List all roles for your team:

```bash
vastai show team-roles
```

View a specific role by name:

```bash
vastai show team-role developer
```

### Update a Role

```bash
vastai update team-role 5 --name "senior-dev" --permissions updated-perms.json
```

### Remove a Role

```bash
vastai remove team-role developer
```

### Invite a Team Member

Assign a role when inviting a new member:

```bash
vastai invite member --email teammate@example.com --role developer
```

### View Team Members

```bash
vastai show members
```

## Examples

### Read-Only Key

A key that can view instances and account info but cannot create, modify, or destroy anything:

```json
{
    "api": {
        "instance_read": {},
        "user_read": {}
    }
}
```

```bash
vastai create api-key --name "monitoring" --permission_file readonly.json
```

### Instance Management Without Billing

A key that can create and manage instances but has no access to billing or credit transfers:

```json
{
    "api": {
        "misc": {},
        "user_read": {},
        "instance_read": {},
        "instance_write": {}
    }
}
```

```bash
vastai create api-key --name "ci-deploy" --permission_file deploy.json
```

### Constrained Key for a Specific Instance

A key that can only manage a single instance (view, reboot, destroy) and nothing else:

```json
{
    "api": {
        "instance_read": {
            "api.instance.show": {
                "constraints": {
                    "id": { "eq": 1227 }
                }
            }
        },
        "instance_write": {
            "api.instance.destroy": {
                "constraints": {
                    "id": { "eq": 1227 }
                }
            },
            "api.instance.reboot": {
                "constraints": {
                    "id": { "eq": 1227 }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```bash
vastai create api-key --name "instance-1227-only" --permission_file constrained.json
```
