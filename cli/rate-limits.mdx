The Vast.ai CLI automatically retries rate-limited requests. You do not need to implement your own retry logic -- the CLI handles HTTP 429 responses with exponential backoff out of the box.

This page covers the error format, how rate limits work, and how to configure the CLI's built-in retry behavior. For the full details on rate limit mechanics, see the [API Rate Limits and Errors](/api-reference/rate-limits-and-errors) page.

## Error Responses

When a CLI command fails, it prints the error message from the API and exits with a non-zero status code. The underlying API error shape is:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "invalid_args",
  "msg": "Human-readable description of the problem."
}
```

Some endpoints omit `success` or `error` and return only `msg` or `message`. The CLI surfaces whatever message the API returns.

## How Rate Limits Work

Vast.ai applies rate limits **per endpoint** and **per identity**. The identity is determined by your bearer token, session user, `api_key` parameter, and client IP.

Some endpoints also enforce **method-specific** limits (GET vs POST) and **max-calls-per-period** limits for short bursts.

For the full breakdown, see [How rate limits are applied](/api-reference/rate-limits-and-errors#how-rate-limits-are-applied).

## Rate Limit Response

When you hit a rate limit, the API returns **HTTP 429** with a message like:

```
API requests too frequent
```

or

```
API requests too frequent: endpoint threshold=...
```

The API does not return a `Retry-After` header. The CLI handles this automatically using its built-in retry logic.

## Built-in Retry Behavior

When the CLI receives an HTTP 429 response, it automatically retries the request using exponential backoff:

- **Retried status codes:** 429 only
- **Default retries:** 3
- **Backoff strategy:** starts at 0.15 seconds, multiplied by 1.5x after each attempt
- **Retry delays:** ~0.15s, ~0.225s, ~0.34s

For most usage, the defaults handle transient rate limits without any intervention.

<Tip>
The CLI only retries on 429 (rate limit). Other HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx) are reported immediately.

## Configuring Retries

Use the `--retry` flag on any command to change the number of retry attempts:

```bash
# Use default 3 retries
vastai search offers 'gpu_name=RTX_4090 rentable=true'

# Increase to 6 retries for a batch script
vastai search offers 'gpu_name=RTX_4090 rentable=true' --retry 6

# Disable retries entirely
vastai search offers 'gpu_name=RTX_4090 rentable=true' --retry 0
```

Increasing the retry count is useful for scripts that make many API calls in sequence, where occasional rate limiting is expected.

## Reducing Rate Limit Errors

If you are consistently hitting rate limits, the best approach is to reduce the volume and frequency of your requests. See [How to reduce rate limit errors](/api-reference/rate-limits-and-errors#how-to-reduce-rate-limit-errors) for practical strategies including batching, reduced polling, and traffic spreading.

If you need higher limits for production usage, contact support with the endpoint(s), your expected call rate, and your account details.
