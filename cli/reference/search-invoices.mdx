Search for invoices using custom query

## Usage

```bash
vastai search invoices [--help] [--api-key API_KEY] [--raw] <query>
```

## Arguments

<ParamField path="query" type="string" required>
  Search query in simple query syntax (see below)
</ParamField>

## Description

Query syntax:

        query = comparison comparison...
        comparison = field op value
        field = &lt;name of a field&gt;
        op = one of: &lt;, &lt;=, ==, !=, &gt;=, &gt;, in, notin
        value = &lt;bool, int, float, string&gt; | 'any' | [value0, value1, ...]
        bool: True, False

    note: to pass '&gt;' and '&lt;' on the command line, make sure to use quotes
    note: to encode a string query value (ie for gpu_name), replace any spaces ' ' with underscore '_'
