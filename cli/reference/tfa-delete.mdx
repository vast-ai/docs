## Description

Remove a 2FA method from your account.

This action requires 2FA verification to prevent unauthorized removals.

************************************************************************************************************************
NOTE: If you do not specify --id-to-delete, the system will attempt to delete the method you are using to authenticate.
      However please be advised, it is much safer to specify the ID to avoid confusion if you have multiple methods.
************************************************************************************************************************

   Use `vastai tfa status` to see your active methods and their IDs.

## Examples

```bash
# Delete method #123, authorize with TOTP/Authenticator code
 vastai tfa delete --id-to-delete 123 --code 456789

 # Delete method #123, authorize with SMS and secret from `tfa send-sms`
 vastai tfa delete -id 123 --sms --secret abc123def456 -c 456789

 # Delete method #123, authorize with backup code
 vastai tfa delete --id-to-delete 123 --backup-code ABCD-EFGH-IJKL

 # Delete method #123, specify which TOTP method to use if you have multiple
 vastai tfa delete -id 123 --method-id 456 -c 456789

 # Delete the TOTP method you are using to authenticate (use with caution)
 vastai tfa delete -c 456789
```
