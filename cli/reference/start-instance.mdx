Start a stopped instance

## Usage

```bash
vastai start instance ID [OPTIONS]
```

## Arguments

<ParamField path="id" type="integer" required>
  ID of instance to start/restart
</ParamField>

## Description

This command attempts to bring an instance from the "stopped" state into the "running" state. This is subject to resource availability on the machine that the instance is located on.
If your instance is stuck in the "scheduling" state for more than 30 seconds after running this, it likely means that the required resources on the machine to run your instance are currently unavailable.

## Examples

```bash
vastai start instances $(vastai show instances -q)
    vastai start instance 329838
```
