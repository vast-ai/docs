Create a new team

## Usage

```bash
vastai create-team --team_name TEAM_NAME
```

## Options

<ParamField path="--team_name" type="string">
  name of the team
</ParamField>

## Description

Creates a new team under your account.

Unlike legacy teams, this command does NOT convert your personal account into a team.
Each team is created as a separate account, and you can be a member of multiple teams.

When you create a team:
  - You become the team owner.
  - The team starts as an independent account with its own billing, credits, and resources.
  - Default roles (owner, manager, member) are automatically created.
  - You can invite others, assign roles, and manage resources within the team.

Optional:
  You can transfer a portion of your existing personal credits to the team by using
  the `--transfer_credit` flag. Example:
      vastai create-team --team_name myteam --transfer_credit 25

Notes:
  - You cannot create a team from within another team account.
