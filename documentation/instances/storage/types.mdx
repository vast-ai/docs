title: Storage Types
description: Understand the different storage options available on Vast.ai instances, including container storage and volumes.

## Storage Overview

Vast.ai provides two main types of storage for your instances:

1. **Container Storage** - Temporary storage within Docker container that's deleted with instance
2. **Volumes** - Persistent local storage that survives instance deletion (see [Volumes guide](/documentation/instances/storage/volumes))

## Container Storage

Container storage is the default storage allocated to every instance when it's created.

### Key Characteristics

- **Size is fixed at creation**: You must specify the disk size when creating the instance
- **Cannot be resized**: Once created, the allocation cannot be changed
- **Persists while instance exists**: Data remains even when instance is stopped
- **Deleted with instance**: All data is permanently lost when instance is destroyed
- **Charged continuously**: Storage costs apply even when instance is stopped

### Default Allocation

- Minimum: 10GB (default)
- Maximum: Varies by host machine capacity
- Set via disk size slider during instance creation

<Warning>
Storage charges continue even when instances are stopped. To stop storage billing, you must destroy the instance completely.
</Warning>

### Best Practices

1. **Estimate generously**: Better to have extra space than run out mid-task
2. **Monitor usage**: Check disk space regularly with `df -h`
3. **Clean up regularly**: Remove unnecessary files to free space
4. **Back up important data**: Container storage is lost when instance is destroyed

## Volumes

Volumes provide persistent storage that survives instance destruction and can be reattached to new instances.

### Key Features

- **Local only**: Tied to the physical machine where created
- **Persistent**: Survives instance destruction
- **Reattachable**: Can be mounted to new instances on same machine
- **Fixed size**: Cannot be resized after creation
- **Separate billing**: Charged independently from instances

### Volume Limitations

- Cannot migrate between different physical machines
- Can only attach to instances on the same host
- Must destroy attached instance before deleting volume
- Size must be specified at creation time

For detailed volume management, see [Volumes](/documentation/instances/storage/volumes).

## Storage Costs

Storage pricing varies by host and includes:

1. **Container storage**: Charged per GB while instance exists
2. **Volume storage**: Charged per GB while volume exists
3. **Different rates**: Stopped instances may have higher storage rates than running instances

## Data Persistence Strategy

### Temporary Work
Use container storage for:
- Temporary files
- Build artifacts
- Cache data
- Working datasets

### Important Data
Use volumes or cloud sync for:
- Trained models
- Datasets
- Code repositories
- Configuration files

### Backup Options

1. **Volumes**: For same-machine persistence
2. **Cloud Sync**: For off-machine backup (Google Drive, S3, etc.)
3. **Instance-to-instance copy**: Transfer between instances
4. **SCP/SFTP**: Download to local machine

## Common Questions

### Can I increase storage after instance creation?
No, container storage size is fixed at creation. You can:
- Create a new instance with more storage and [transfer your data](/documentation/instances/storage/data-movement)
- Attach a volume for additional space
- Use cloud storage for overflow

### What happens to my data when the instance stops?
- Container storage: Data persists, charges continue
- Volumes: Data persists, charges continue
- No data is lost when stopping instances

### How do I avoid storage charges?
- Destroy instances you're not using
- Delete unneeded volumes
- Transfer important data to local/cloud storage first
