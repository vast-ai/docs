Renting an instance on Vast.ai involves three main steps that work together to get you the exact computing environment you need.

## The Rental Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your Template">
    Select or customize a Docker template that defines your software environment - PyTorch, TensorFlow, Stable Diffusion, or custom configurations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Your GPU">
    Search and filter through available offers to find GPUs that match your performance needs and budget.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure & Rent">
    Set your disk size, review the offer details, and launch your instance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You'll Need to Decide

Before renting an instance, you'll make key decisions about:

- **Software Environment**: Which Docker image and launch mode (SSH, Jupyter, etc.)
- **Hardware Requirements**: GPU type, VRAM, CPU, and system RAM needed
- **Storage Size**: How much disk space (cannot be changed after creation)
- **Instance Type**: On-demand for reliability or interruptible for cost savings
- **Budget**: Maximum price you're willing to pay per hour

## Quick Start Path

For the fastest path to a running instance:

1. **Use a Recommended Template** - Pre-configured and tested
2. **Sort by Price** - Find the best deals quickly
3. **Check Reliability Score** - 95%+ for important work
4. **Start with On-demand** - Upgrade to reserved later if needed

## What's in This Section

- **[Instance Types](/documentation/instances/choosing/instance-types)** - Understand on-demand vs interruptible vs reserved options
- **[Choosing a Template](/documentation/instances/choosing/templates)** - Understanding and selecting templates
- **[Finding & Renting](/documentation/instances/choosing/find-and-rent)** - Search, filter, configure, and rent
- **[Reserved Instances](/documentation/instances/choosing/reserved-instances)** - Save up to 50% with prepayment

## Common Questions

### How long does it take to start an instance?
Usually under 5 minutes with recommended templates. Large custom images may take longer on first launch.

### Can I change my configuration later?
- **Template**: No, you need a new instance
- **Disk size**: No, fixed at creation
- **Instance type**: Can convert on-demand to reserved only

### What if the GPU I want isn't available?
Set up search alerts or try different regions. Availability changes frequently as a marketplace.
