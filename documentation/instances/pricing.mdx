description: Understand Vast.ai's marketplace pricing model, rental types, and costs for GPU instances and serverless computing.
---

<Tip>
Vast.ai operates as a marketplace, connecting users with GPU providers worldwide. This means prices vary based on supply and demand, giving you access to competitive rates for GPU computing.
</Tip>

## How Vast.ai Pricing Works

Unlike traditional cloud providers with fixed pricing, Vast.ai uses a **marketplace model** where hosts set their own prices. This means there are no static price quotes for instances, but you should expect better end prices on GPU instances due to the competitive marketplace.

You can easily check current market rates:
- **Web interface**: [Search dashboard](https://cloud.vast.ai/create/) shows real-time prices
- **CLI**: Use `vastai search offers` to query prices programmatically (see [CLI Commands](/cli/commands#search-offers))
- **API**: Query programmatically via the [search offers endpoint](/api-reference/search/search-offers)

### Key Pricing Principles

- **Pay-as-you-go**: Billed by the second for actual usage
- **Pre-payment required**: Add credits to your account before renting
- **No hidden fees**: Transparent pricing for compute, storage, and bandwidth
- **Market-driven rates**: Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand

## Rental Types

Vast.ai offers three rental options, each suited for different workloads and budgets:

### On-demand (High Priority)
**Best for**: Production workloads, time-sensitive tasks, guaranteed availability

- Fixed price set by the host
- Exclusive control over GPU(s)
- Runs uninterrupted for the contract duration
- Cannot be preempted by other users

### Reserved (Discounted)
**Best for**: Long-term projects with predictable resource needs

- Convert on-demand rentals to reserved for up to 50% discount
- Prepay for months in advance
- Locked to specific instance
- Full refund if machine fails SLA

### Interruptible (Low Priority)
**Best for**: Batch processing, fault-tolerant workloads, cost optimization

- Bid-based pricing system
- Can be 50%+ cheaper than on-demand
- May be paused if outbid
- Ideal for horizontal scaling scenarios

For detailed rental type comparisons, see [Rental Types](/documentation/instances/rental-types) and [Reserved Instance Discounts](/documentation/instances/reserved-instance-discounts).

## Cost Components

Your total cost consists of several components:

### 1. GPU Compute Costs
- **Pricing**: Varies by GPU model, host, and location
- **Billing**: Per second while instance is running
- **Factors affecting price**:
  - GPU model (RTX 3090, A100, H100, etc.)
  - Number of GPUs
  - Host reliability score
  - Geographic location
  - Market demand

### 2. Storage Costs
- **Active instances**: $0.10/GB/month
- **Stopped instances**: $0.20/GB/month
- **Billing**: Calculated continuously while instance exists
- **Note**: Storage charges apply even when instance is stopped

### 3. Bandwidth Costs
- **Pricing**: Varies by host
- **Includes**: Both upload and download
- **Billing**: Charged per byte transferred
- **Tip**: Check bandwidth rates before selecting an instance

## Pricing by Service

### Instance Pricing
GPU instances on Vast.ai are priced dynamically based on market conditions. To find current prices:

1. Visit the [Search page](https://cloud.vast.ai/create/)
2. Filter by your requirements (GPU type, location, etc.)
3. Compare offers from different hosts
4. Hover over prices to see detailed breakdown

Key factors to consider:
- **Reliability score**: Higher reliability may cost more but ensures stability
- **DLPerf score**: Performance benchmarks help compare value
- **Maximum duration**: Ensure it meets your project timeline

### Serverless Pricing
Vast.ai also offers Serverless computing with its own pricing model based on automatic GPU recruitment and pay-per-use scaling.

<Info>
Serverless has different pricing mechanics than instances. See [Serverless Pricing](/documentation/serverless/pricing) for complete details on how Serverless endpoints are billed.
</Info>

## Payment and Billing

### Payment Methods
- **Credit/Debit cards** via Stripe
- **Cryptocurrency** via Crypto.com and Coinbase
- **No refunds** for spent credits
- **Refunds available** for unspent credits (except crypto)

### Billing Mechanics
1. **Pre-payment required**: Add credits before renting
2. **Real-time deduction**: Credits deducted every few seconds
3. **Auto-stop at zero**: Instances stop when balance depletes
4. **Storage continues**: Stopped instances still incur storage fees

### Auto-debit Options
- Set balance thresholds for automatic top-ups
- Receive notifications before balance runs low
- Prevent service interruptions

<Warning>
When your balance reaches zero, instances are stopped but not deleted. You continue to be charged for storage. Ensure you delete instances when no longer needed to avoid ongoing charges.
</Warning>

## Cost Optimization Tips

### 1. Choose the Right Rental Type
- Use **interruptible** for batch jobs and experiments
- Select **on-demand** only when reliability is critical
- Consider **reserved** for long-running projects

### 2. Optimize Storage
- Delete instances when complete (not just stop)
- Use smaller disk allocations when possible
- Transfer results to external storage regularly

### 3. Compare Offers
- Sort by $/hr to find best deals
- Balance price with reliability scores
- Consider geographic regions with lower demand

### 4. Monitor Usage
- Track spending in the [Billing page](https://cloud.vast.ai/billing/)
- Set up balance alerts
- Review transaction history regularly

## Pricing Tools

### Price Estimation
To estimate costs for your workload:
1. Use the search interface to find suitable instances
2. Hover over prices to see hourly breakdown
3. Calculate: (GPU $/hr + Storage $/hr) Ã— Expected hours
4. Add estimated bandwidth costs

### Price Comparison
The search interface allows you to:
- Sort by price per hour
- Filter by maximum budget
- Compare performance per dollar (DLPerf/$/hr)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does Vast.ai cost compared to other providers?
Vast.ai uses a marketplace model where hosts set competitive prices. You can compare current prices on the [Search page](https://cloud.vast.ai/create/).

### Am I charged when instances are stopped?
Yes, you're charged storage costs ($0.20/GB/month) for stopped instances. Delete instances to stop all charges.

### Can prices change during my rental?
No, once you rent an instance, the price is locked for your rental period (on-demand and reserved only).

### What happens if my balance runs out?
Your instances are automatically stopped but not deleted. Add credits to resume operations.
