## Overview

The Instances page ([cloud.vast.ai/instances](https://cloud.vast.ai/instances)) is your central hub for managing rented instances. From here you can:

- View instance status and information
- Start, stop, and destroy instances
- Access connection details
- Monitor resource usage
- Transfer data between instances

## Instance Card Interface

<Frame caption="Instances Page">

</Frame>

Each instance card displays comprehensive information about your rental:

### Main Status Button

<Frame caption="Open button">
![](/images/console-instance-guide-2.webp)
</Frame>

The main button (left side of card) shows instance status and provides quick access:

**Status Indicators:**
- **Open**: Instance loaded, click to access via browser
- **Connect**: Instance loaded, click for SSH info
- **Inactive**: Stopped but data preserved (can restart if GPU available)
- **Offline**: Machine disconnected from Vast servers
- **Scheduling**: Attempting to restart (waiting for GPU availability)
- **Creating**: Vast initiating instance creation
- **Loading**: Downloading Docker image
- **Connecting**: Docker running but connection not verified

### Instance Information

<Frame caption="ID numbers">
![](/images/console-instance-guide-9.webp)
</Frame>

**ID Information:**
- Instance ID - Unique identifier for your instance
- Host/Datacenter ID - Provider identification
- Machine ID - Physical machine identifier

**Hardware Details:**
![](/images/console-instance-guide-10.webp)
- GPU model and count
- CPU and RAM allocation
- Storage capacity
- Network configuration

**Contract Info:**
![](/images/console-instance-guide-12.webp)
- Instance age (time since creation)
- Expiry date (contract end time)
- Remaining duration

## Instance Operations

### Starting, Stopping, and Destroying

![](/images/console-instance-guide-5.webp)

- **Stop Button** (square icon): Pauses instance, preserves data, continues storage charges
- **Destroy Button** (trash icon): Permanently deletes instance and all data
- **Restart Button** (play icon): Appears when stopped, attempts to reclaim GPU

<Warning>
**Important:** Stopped instances continue incurring storage charges. Destroy instances when no longer needed to avoid ongoing costs.
</Warning>

### Restart Behavior

<Frame caption="Play button">
![](/images/console-instance-guide-6.webp)
</Frame>

When restarting a stopped instance:
1. Instance enters `SCHEDULING` status
2. Waits for GPU availability
3. If stuck >30 seconds, GPU likely rented by another user
4. Cancel scheduling by clicking stop again
5. Consider creating new instance if GPU unavailable

### Additional Controls

![](/images/console-instance-guide-13.webp)

- **Label Instance** - Add custom name for identification
- **Reboot Instance** - Restart without data loss
- **View Logs** - Access Docker container logs

## Data Management

<Frame caption="Data movement">
![](/images/console-instance-guide-7.webp)
</Frame>

- **Copy Data** - Transfer between your instances (see [Data Movement](/documentation/instances/storage/data-movement))
- **Cloud Sync** - Sync with cloud providers (see [Cloud Sync](/documentation/instances/storage/cloud-sync))

<Note>
Use Cloud Sync only on trusted datacenters (indicated by **Secure** icon).
</Note>

## Connection Quick Reference

For detailed connection instructions, see [Connect to Instances](/documentation/instances/connect/overview):
- **SSH button** - Shows SSH command
- **Open button** - Launches web UI
- **IP/Ports button** - Network information

## Troubleshooting Instance States

### Instance Stuck on "Loading"
- Normal for 30 seconds with cached images
- Can take hours with slow internet/large images
- Not charged during loading
- Try machines with faster internet

### Instance Stuck on "Scheduling"
When stopped instances try to restart:
- GPU may be reassigned to other users
- High-priority jobs block restart
- May wait indefinitely for GPU availability
- Consider copying data to new instance

### Instance Stuck on "Connecting"
- Port configuration may be broken
- Report the machine
- Try different machine

### Machine Shows "Offline"
- Lost connection to Vast servers
- Often internet/power issues
- Host notified automatically
- May be maintenance or unforeseen problems

## Important Considerations

### Data Persistence
- **Stopped instances**: Data preserved, storage charges continue
- **Destroyed instances**: All data permanently deleted
- **Before destroying**: Copy important data or sync to cloud

### Contract Expiration
<Warning>
Expired instances may be deleted 48 hours after expiration. Expired instances cannot restart. Retrieve your data promptly.
</Warning>

### Security
- Hosts can technically access files on their machines
- For sensitive data, use verified datacenters
- Implement encryption for critical data

### IP Addresses
Some instances have dynamic IPs that may change. Check IP type via the IP button on instance card. For static IPs, filter by "Static IP Address" when searching.

## Common Questions

### Can I run Docker inside my instance?
No, instances are already Docker containers. Docker-in-Docker is not supported.

### Do I pay for "Loading" instances?
No, you're not charged while instances show "Loading" status.

### Can I view past instances?
No, destroyed instances cannot be viewed. Recent template history is preserved for configuration reference.

### Why is my machine location showing only ", US"?
This means geolocation couldn't determine the state. It's not an indication of reliability.

### Can I run VMs or bare metal?
Currently only Docker containers are supported. VM and bare-metal options planned for future.
