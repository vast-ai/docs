## **Reserved Instance Discounts at Vast.ai**

At Vast.ai, we’re always working to make cloud computing more **efficient** and **cost-effective**. Our feature — **Reserved Instance Discounts** — helps you **save up to 50% or more** on long-term compute needs while giving providers more consistent revenue.

## **Why Use Reserved Instance Discounts**

With **on-demand instances**, you:

- Pay only for the time you use (pay-as-you-go).
- Can stop the contract at any time.&#x20;
  - **Note:** If you stop the instance, the GPU will be released and may be rented by another user. If you want to keep using it, you will need to wait until the GPU becomes free again.

For users with **predictable, long-term needs**, on-demand isn’t always the most cost-efficient choice. **Reserved Instance Discounts** let you:&#x20;

- pre-paid - commit in advance,&#x20;
- fixed term - reserve for 1, 3, or 6 months (or custom durations via CLI),
- trading flexibility for significant savings,
- **Best for:**
  - Long-term projects
  - Continuous workloads
  - Stable, predictable GPU needs

<Warning>
  Warning: If you stop a reserved instance, the GPU will be released and can be rented by someone else. There’s no benefit to stopping it.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Tip:** Depositing more funds recalculates your discount — larger deposits generally mean bigger discounts.
</Note>

## **How It Works**

You can **convert an on-demand instance into a reserved instance** with a lower hourly rate by pre-paying.

**Ways to reserve:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Web UI">
    **Step 1 — Rent the Instance&#x20;**

    1. Go to [Search](https://cloud.vast.ai/create/) page.
    2. Find a GPU that meets your requirements, click the **Rent** button.
    3. This creates an **on-demand instance**.

    **Step 2 — Convert to a Reserved Instance**

    1. Go to the [**Instances**](https://cloud.vast.ai/instances/) page.
    2. On your instance card, find the **green** **discount badge**.&#x20;

       <Frame caption="Save badge">
       ![Save badge](/images/instances-reserved.webp)
       </Frame>
    3. Click the badge — a new window will open with the **available pre-paid periods** (e.g., 1 month, 3 months, 6 months).

       <Frame caption="Add Reserved Discount">
       ![Reserved Discount](/images/instances-reserved-2.webp)
       </Frame>
    4. Select your preferred period and confirm. The system calculates deposit and discount automatically.

    Your instance is now reserved at the discounted rate. When an instance is converted to a reserved instance, you will see **Saved %** badge on the instance card to indicate the reserved discount is active. This lets you quickly identify which of your running instances are benefiting from pre-paid rates.&#x20;

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI">
    1. **Add credits** to your account (if needed).
    2. Create an instance, get the instance id. CLI:`vastai show instances`
    3. Run the following command, where:
       **ID** is the id of instance to prepay for
       **AMOUNT** is amount of instance credit prepayment (default discount func of 0.2 for 1 month, 0.3 for 3 months)


      ```cli CLI
      vastai prepay instance ID AMOUNT
      ```
 

    An example:

      ```cli CLI
      vastai prepay instance 24973511 50
      prepaid for 0.546 months of instance 24973511 applying $50.0 credits for a discount of 3.5000000000000004%
      ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  Add a Reserved Instance Discount to this instance to save money on your hourly rate. By adding a Reserved Instance Discount to an instance you will allocate credits to the instance from your account. These credits will be used to pay for the instance's hourly rate. If you run out of credits, you will be charged the hourly rate for the instance.
</Note>

## **Extending a Reserved Instance**

You can extend your reservation via:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="web UI">
    Same flow as above - via **Save&#x20;**&#x62;adge on instance card.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI">
    More flexibility — deposit any amount you choose. For example:

    ```bash Bash
    vastai prepay instance 24973511 50
    prepaid for 0.546 months of instance 24973511 applying $50.0 credits for a discount of 3.5000000000000004%
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  **Important:**
  Every time you add credits, your discount is recalculated.
  Avoid adding small amounts mid-term — you could end up with a worse rate.
  For example:
  If you have a 3-month reservation and add 2 weeks of credit with only 2 weeks left, your discount could drop.
</Warning>

## **Refunds**

You can cancel (destroy) a reserved / prepaid instance to get part of your deposit back.
Refund = Remaining deposit **minus** total discount already received.

**Example:**

- On-demand: $1/hr → $720/month
- Reserved (1 month): $576/month
- Cancel immediately → Refund = $576
- Cancel after 15 days → Remaining = $288 → Refund = $216 (after discount penalty)
- Cancel at the end → Refund = $0

You will see the refund on the Billing page -> Invoices table.

### **Can I switch an existing on-demand instance to reserved?**

Yes, if there is an available discount. Go to the **Instances** page, click the **discount badge** on your instance card, choose a period, and confirm.

### **Can I extend a reserved instance?**

Yes — you can extend it anytime via the same discount badge in the Instances page, as long as the instance still has an active discount period. You can use the CLI for custom amounts.&#x20;

### **What happens if I cancel / delete a reserved instance early?**

You’ll receive a partial refund of your unused pre-paid balance, minus the total discount received so far. You will see the refund on Billing page.

### **What happens if I stop a reserved instance?**

If you stop the instance, the GPU will be released like any other instance and may be rented by another user.&#x20;
