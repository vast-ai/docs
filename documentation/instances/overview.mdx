## What Are Instances?

Instances are containerized environments where you rent dedicated GPUs from Vast.ai's marketplace. Each instance:

- Provides exclusive GPU access (never shared between users)
- Runs your choice of Docker image
- Includes proportional CPU, RAM, and storage
- Connects via SSH, Jupyter, or custom entrypoint
- Bills by the second for actual usage
