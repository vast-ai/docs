## What is the Instance Portal?

The Instance Portal is the first application you will see after clicking the 'Open' button to access an instance that has been loaded with a [Vast.ai Docker image](https://github.com/vast-ai/base-image/). Many of our recommended templates include the Instance Portal.

## Loading Process

Upon opening the Instance Portal you will see a loading indicator for a short time.&#x20;

</Frame>

During this loading phase, a secure Cloudflare tunnel will be created for each of your instance's open ports and the browser will test whether these tunnel links are accessible.

The secure tunnel link will be formatted like this:

https\://four-randomly-selected-words.trycloudflare.com

When the secure tunnel for port `1111` becomes accessible, the instance Portal will redirect to this link before revealing the full interface.

If it is taking too long for the tunnels to be ready, you will see the Instance Portal interface revealed at `http://ip_address:port_1111`

If you would like the default application URLs to be **https\://** rather than **http\://** you can add the following environment variable to your [account level environment variables](https://cloud.vast.ai/account/):

If you set this variable, it is important to add the Vast.ai Jupyter certificate  to your local system to avoid browser warnings.  See [this page](https://docs.vast.ai/instances/jupyter#1SmCz) for more information about installing the certificate.

## Landing Page

The instance Portal has a simple interface to help you access other web applications that may be running in the instance. See the configuration section of this document for further details on application startup.

</Frame>

The large blue 'Launch Application' buttons will open your running applications in a new browser tab. &#x20;

If a secure tunnel is available, the button will open the 'trycloudflare.com' link.  If a tunnel is not yet available then the button will open the direct IP address link.

In both cases, a secure token is appended to the link to prevent unauthorised access to your applications.

You can also click the 'Advanced Connection Options' link to see all available connection methods.

## Tunnels Page

Use this page to manage existing secure tunnels and add new tunnels to get access to ports that have not directly been opened in the instance



<Frame caption="Tunnels Page">

Use this interface to create links to applications you have started after configuring your instance. For example:

If you started an instance but later decide that you want to install some new software that listens on port `7860`, it will not be available directly if you did not configure the port when creating or editing the template.

Simply enter `http://localhost:7860` in the top input box and click the blue 'Create New Tunnel' button.  A tunnel will be created for this port. It may take a moment to be available after creation.&#x20;

You can use the 'Manage' buttons to stop existing tunnels or to refresh them if you want a new URL.

If you would like to link your own domain name to the instance then please see 'Named Tunnels' in the configuration section of this document.

## Instance Logs Page

The logs page will show a live stream of entries added to any `.log` files in the `/var/log/portal/` directory.



Use the 'Copy Logs' button to copy the currently displayed logging output to your clipboard.  You can also use the 'Download Logs' button to download a zip file containing all files and directories in the `/var/log/` directory of your instance.

## Tools & Help Page

This page links to useful pages in the Vast.ai documentation to help you get the most from your instance.

## Configuration

Initial configuration of the Instance Portal is via the `PORTAL_CONFIG` enviroment variable.  The default value looks like this:

```bash Bash
localhost:1111:11111:/:Instance Portal|localhost:8080:18080:/:Jupyter|localhost:8080:8080:/terminals/1:Jupyter Terminal|localhost:8384:18384:/:Syncthing|localhost:6006:16006:/:Tensorboard
```

Each application is separated by a pipe (`|`) character, and each application option is separated by a colon (`:`)&#x20;

For each application, we provide the following configuration options

- Interface to bind the application (currently always `localhost`)
- External port to proxy the application. This must have been added to the template. Eg. `-p 1111:1111`)
- Internal port where the running application will be bound
- URL path for links to open (often `/`)
- Application Name

Where the external port and internal port **are not equal**, a reverse proxy (Caddy) will make your application available on the external port.

Where the external port and internal port **are equal** the application will not be proxied to the external port but secure tunnel application links will be created.

### In Place Configuration

On first boot the configuration variable will be processed and is used to create the configuration file `/etc/portal.yaml`

You can edit this file in a running instance to add or remove applications from the interface.

Any applications you have added after the instance has started will not initially be reachable so you will need to reboot the instance.

### Disable Default Applictions

The startup scripts we use for the default applications we provide will read this configuration and will not start if they are not specified in the configuration file.

### Named Tunnels

While the default behavior of the Instance Portal is to create 'quick' tunnels with a randomly assigned subdomain of 'trycloudflare.com', it is also possible to assign a pre-configured subdomain of your own domain name.

To do this you will need a free [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) account and a domain name linked to that account.

Here's an example of how your tunnel configuration might look in the Cloudflare dashboard:

![Example named tunnel configuration](/images/console-templates-instance-portal-8.webp)

Once you have created your named tunnel, you can link it to your instance by providing the token associated with your tunnel as the value of environment variable `CF_TUNNEL_TOKEN`. You can save this in the 'Environment Variables' section in your [account settings](https://cloud.vast.ai/account/) or directly in the template if you are saving it privately.

If the instance is already running you can provide then token in the `/etc/environment` file and reboot the instance.

Named tunnels are generally more reliable than quick tunnels and will provide consistent URLs you can use to access applications running in an instance.

When named tunnels are configured, the 'Launch Application' button will direct to the named tunnel rather than the quick tunnel.

**Important:&#x20;**&#x55;sing the same tunnel token for multiple running instances is not possible and will cause broken links.  If you need several instances then you will need a separate tunnel token for each of them.
