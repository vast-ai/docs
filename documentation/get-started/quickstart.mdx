This Quickstart will guide you through setting up your Vast.ai account and running your first instance in just a few steps.&#x20;

### 1. Sign Up & Add Credit

- Create an account on [vast.ai.](https://cloud.vast.ai/)
- Verify your email address.
- Go to [**Billing**](https://cloud.vast.ai/billing/) → **Add Credit** and top up using credit card, Coinbase, or Crypto.com.

<Note>
  Before you can **rent a machine&#x20;**&#x6F;r **create a team**, you must verify your email address. After signing up, check your inbox (and spam folder) for the verification email  and click the link inside. You can resend the verification email anytime from **Settings → Resend Verification Email.**
</Note>

### &#x32;**. Prepare to Connect**

- **For SSH access**: generate an [SSH key pair](https://docs.vast.ai/instances/sshscp) and upload your **public key** in [Keys page](https://cloud.vast.ai/manage-keys/).

- **For Jupyter access**: download and install the provided [TSL certificate](https://docs.vast.ai/instances/jupyter#1SmCz) (needed for secure browser access).

<Note>
  If you don’t install the provided browser certificate:&#x20;

  - **Windows / Linux** – You’ll see a **“Your connection is not private”** privacy warning. You can still connect by clicking **Advanced** → **Proceed**, but the warning will appear every time.
  - **macOS** – Browsers will block Jupyter until you install and trust the provided certificate in **Keychain Access**. Without it, you won’t be able to connect.

  Installing the certificate once removes the warning permanently.
</Note>

  ### &#x33;**. Pick a&#x20;**[**Template**](https://docs.vast.ai/templates)**&#x20;& Find a Machine**

  - Browse [**Templates**](https://cloud.vast.ai/templates/) for pre-built setups (e.g., [PyTorch](https://docs.vast.ai/pytorch), TensorFlow, ComfyUI).
- Go to [**Search**](https://cloud.vast.ai/create/) and filter by GPU type, count, RAM, CPU, network speed, and price.
- **Disk Space is Permanent.&#x20;**&#x54;he disk size you choose when creating an instance cannot be changed later. If you run out of space, you’ll need to create a new instance with a larger disk. Tip: Allocate a bit more than you think you need to avoid interruptions.
- Click **Rent** when you find a match.
- Wait for the instance to start—cached images launch quickly, fresh pulls may take 10–60 minutes.
- Click **Open** button to access your instance.

### **4.&#x20;**[**Manage or End Your Instance**](https://docs.vast.ai/instances-guide)

- Use **Stop** to pause GPU billing (storage still accrues charges).
- Use **Delete** when finished to stop *all* charges.

## Common Questions

### What is a minimum deposit amount?

The minimum deposit amount on Vast.ai is $5.

### What happens when my balance runs out? Can I avoid interruptions?

When your balance reaches zero, your running instances will automatically stop. To avoid this, you can enable **auto-billing&#x20;**&#x6F;n the Billing page. Set an auto-charge threshold higher than your average daily spend, so your card is automatically charged when your balance falls below that amount. We also recommend setting a **low-balance email alert&#x20;**&#x61;t a slightly lower threshold to notify you if the auto-charge fails for any reason.&#x20;

### How can I customize a template?

You can create a new template from scratch, or you can edit an existing template. You can find a guide [here](https://docs.vast.ai/templates#LrOME).&#x20;
