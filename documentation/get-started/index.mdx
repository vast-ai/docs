# Vast.ai

[Vast.ai](https://www.vast.ai) is a marketplace for affordable GPU cloud computing. We make it easy for anyone to:

- Spin up GPU instances in seconds at competitive [prices](https://vast.ai/pricing).
- Scale across thousands of GPUs from [Secure Cloud datacenters](https://cloud.vast.ai/create/?instanceDiskSizeMin=16&instanceDurationMin=259200&instanceType=onDemand&isAvxSupported=false&isHostSecure=true&isMachineIpStatic=false&isOfferAvailable=true&isOfferCompatible=true&isOfferVerified=true&isQueryInverted=false&machineReliabilityMin=0.9&sorts=score-desc) or community providers.
- Launch [prebuilt](https://cloud.vast.ai/templates/) or [custom templates](/documentation/templates/creating-templates) with one click.

## How It Works

Vast.ai connects compute providers — from hobbyists to Tier-4 datacenters — with users who need GPUs. Our search engine lets you filter by GPU type, RAM, CPU, bandwidth, and more, while providers retain full control over pricing and contracts.

## Getting started

Ready to get started? Follow our [Quick Start Guide](/documentation/get-started/quickstart) to launch your first instance.

## Mission

Vast.ai's mission is to align and democratize AI. Machine learning is progressing towards powerful AI systems with the potential to radically reshape our future. We believe it is imperative that this awesome power be distributed widely; that its benefits accrue to the many rather than the few; that its secrets are unlocked for the good of all humanity. Towards these ends we work to ensure that the compute powering AI is supplied by the people and for the people.
