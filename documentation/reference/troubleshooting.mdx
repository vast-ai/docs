### I stopped my instance, and now when I try to restart it the status is stuck on "scheduling". What is wrong?

When you stop an instance, the gpu(s) it was using may get reassigned. When you later then try to restart the instance, it tries to get those gpu(s) back - that is the "scheduling" phase. If another high priority job is currently using any of the same gpu(s), your instance will be stuck in "scheduling" phase until the conflicting jobs are done. We know this is not ideal, and we are working on ways to migrate containers across gpus and machines, but until then we recommend not stopping an instance unless you are ok with the risk of waiting a while to restart it."

### All my instances keep stopping, switching to inactive status, even though I didn't press the stop button. What's going on?

Check your credit balance. If it hits zero or below, your instances will be stopped automatically.

### I keep getting this error: spend\_rate\_limit. What's going on?

There is a spend rate limit for new accounts. The limit is extremely small for unverified accounts, so make sure to verify your email. The limit increases over time, so try a cheaper instance type or wait a few hours. If you are still having trouble, use the online support chat in the lower right.

### I tried to connect with ssh and it asked for a password. What is the password?

There is no ssh password, we use ssh key authentication. If ssh asks for a password, typically this means there is something wrong with the ssh key that you entered or your ssh client is misconfigured.

On Ubuntu or Mac, first you need to generate an rsa ssh public/private keypair using the command:

```text
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

Next you may need to force the daemon to load the new private key, and confirm it's loaded:

```text
    ssh-add; ssh-add -l
```

Then get the contents of the public key with:

```text
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy the entire output to your clipboard, then paste that into a new SSH Key in your [Keys section](https://cloud.vast.ai/manage-keys/). The key text *includes* the opening "ssh-rsa" part and the ending "user\@something" part. If you don't copy the entire thing, it won't work.

Example SSH key text:

```text
    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDdxWwxwN5Lz7ubkMrxM5FCHhVzOnZuLt5FHi7J8zFXCJHfr96w+ccBOBo2rtBBTTRDLnJjIsKLgBcC3+jGyZhpUNMFRVIJ7MeqdEHgHFvUUV/uBkb7RjbyyFcb4BCSYNggUZkMNNoNgEa3aqtBSzt47bnuGqqszs9bfDCaPFtr9Wo0b8p4IYil/gfOYBkuSVwkqrBCWrg53/+T2rAk/02mWNHXyBktJAu1q7qTWcyO68JTDd0sa+4apSu+CsJMBJs3FcDDRAl3bcpiKwRbCkQ+N6sol4xDV3zQRebUc98CJPh04Gnc41W02lmdqGL2XG5U/rV8/JM7CawKiIz3dbkv bob@velocity
