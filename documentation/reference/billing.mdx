## Overview

Vast requires pre-payment of credits for GPU rentals. Once credits are purchased, they appear in your account balance.

We accept credit card payments through Stripe and crypto payments through Crypto.com and Coinbase. Use the add credit button to purchase credits one-time. Use the autobilling feature to have the system automatically top up your account using a saved credit card when it runs low.

### Negative Balances

Once your credits reach $0.00, your instances, storage volumes, and data **will be scheduled for deletion** unless you add credits to make your balance positive again.


- **When your balance reaches zero (or below):**
  - Your instances are **stopped automatically**.
  - While an instance is stopped, your instance is detached from its GPU(s), but your data can still be copied off the machine.
  - As with any stopped instance, **you will continue to be billed for disk storage** — even if your balance is negative.
- **If you have a payment method saved:**
  - Your credit card will be periodically and automatically charged to cover any negative balance.
  - This allows you to resume using your instances without losing data.
- **If you do not have a payment method saved:**
  - The system will have no backup payment method to charge, and will not be able to top up your balance.
  - Your instances and stored data will be **destroyed** to prevent indefinite unpaid usage.

<Tip>
  Important: Instances showing in your account are **never free**, even if your balance is negative or zero.
</Tip>

### Autobilling (credit card only)

You can set a balance threshold to configure autobilling, which will attempt to maintain your balance above the threshold by charging your card periodically.

We recommend setting a threshold around your daily or weekly spend, and then setting an balance email notification threshold around 75% of that value, so that you get notified if the auto billing fails but long before your balance depletes to zero.


<Warning>
  **WARNING**

  Your card is charged automatically, and any instance on your account comes with charges to your 
  credit balance. Even stopped instances have storage charges. Make sure you destroy instances
  when you are done with them — otherwise, your card will continue to be periodically charged 
  after your balance goes negative.
</Warning>

### Update Frequency

Balances are updated about once every few seconds.

### Credit Card Security

Vast.ai does not see, store or process your credit card numbers, they are passed directly to Stripe (which you can verify in the javascript).

## Refunds

After spending credits, there are absolutely no refunds.

For unspent credits, contact us on the website chat to request a refund. In most cases we can refund unspent credits. Unfortunately Coinbase Commerce does not support refunds, so there are no refunds possible for credits purchased via Coinbase Commerce.

## Pricing

There are separate prices and charges for:

- Active rental (GPU)  (in \$/hr)
- Storage costs (in $/GB/hr)
- Bandwidth costs (in \$/TB)

You are charged the base active rental cost for every second your instance is in the active/connected state.
You are charged the storage cost (which depends on the size of your storage allocation) for every single second your instance exists and is online (for all states other than offline).
Stopping an instance does not avoid storage costs.

You are charged bandwidth prices for every byte sent or received to or from the instance, regardless of what state it is in.
The prices for base rental, storage, and bandwidth vary considerably from machine to machine, so make sure to check them.

You are not charged active rental or storage costs for instances that are currently offline.

To see a pricing breakdown on your current instances within your Instance page in the console or from offers on the Search page you can hover over the price to see pricing details.

### Credits Panel

Here you can see the current amount of Vast credits you have. This section also shows what you are currently spending on instances and storage volumes.

Click the **Transfer Credits** button to open a pop-up. There, you can select the destination account or team to send the credit to.

- To transfer credit to another **user**, you will need their email address.

  ⚠️ This action is irreversible, so please double-check the email before proceeding.

<Frame caption="Transfer Credits pop-up">

</Frame>

- to transfer credit to a **team**, you should be a part of the team.

<Frame caption="Transfer Credit to a team">

- To transfer credit from a team back to a personal account, you must be the team owner. You will need to switch to your team context and open Billing Page form there to see following pop-up.

### Transaction History Table

At the bottom of your billing page, you will find an itemized table of your transactions on Vast. By default, the table is open to the **Invoices** tab, where you can see all manual and automatic billing records, as well as transfers and refunds.

<Frame caption="The Invoices tab of the Transaction History table">
  ![Invoices tab of the Transaction History table](/images/transaction-history-table-invoices.png)
</Frame>

You can also click the **Charges** tab to see an itemized table of all charges from your instances, storage volumes, and serverless workers. Clicking the dropdown arrow on any of these items will display a more complete breakdown of those charges by type, including GPU usage, reserved disk storage, and upload/download usage.

<Frame caption="The Charges tab of the Transaction History table">
  ![Charges tab of the Transaction History table](/images/transaction-history-table-charges.png)
</Frame>

You can also use this table to generate an invoice for all charges or transactions created during a custom span of time by clicking the **Export** button in the top right corner of the table. You can see more details about how to customize this invoice in the following section.

### Invoice Info

Here you can add the information to be shown on invoices you generate.

<Frame caption="Invoice Filled">
  ![Invoice Filled](https://vast.ai/uploads/invoice-filled.png)

Here's an example that shows where and how the invoice info appears on generated invoices:

<Frame caption="Invoice With Fill Circle">
  ![Invoice With Fill Circle](https://vast.ai/uploads/invoice-with-fill-circle.jpg)
</Frame>

If you leave your Invoice Info blank it will default to your Vast account's email address for the "Bill To:" information.

## Common Questions

### If I rent a server and delete if after 10 minutes will I pay for 1 hour of usage or 10 minutes?

You will only be charged for the 10 minutes of usage.

### Can I get a refund?

If you pay with credit card you can get a refund on unspent Vast credits. We do not refund Vast credits bought with crypto.

### Why has the prices changed?

Pricing is fixed by the host, and is specific to each machine and contract. You can refine your search and look for a machine that suits your needs [here](https://cloud.vast.ai/create/).

### Why am I getting the error "No such payment method id None." when I try to add credit?

Before buying credit with Stripe you must add a card\!

### Am I charged for "Loading" instances?

No, you are not charged when it says "Loading".

### What happens if my account balance is negative?

Once your credits reach $0.00, your instances, storage volumes, and data **will no longer be guaranteed, and will be at risk of deletion.** If you have a payment method on file, your instances may persist to be resumed once your balance is positive again.

### Why am I getting charge more per hour than expected?

You may be see your Vast credit decline at a greater rate than expected due to upload and downloads costs, which is not shown in your $cost/hr or$cost/day pricing breakdowns as it is charged on a usage basis and not a constant rate. You can find these rates for bandwidth usage in the Internet: section of the pricing details, which you can see when you hover over the price in the bottom right-hand corner of instance cards within the Instance console page. You can also see pricing detail before instance creation from hovering over the prices on the Search page. You can also get a detailed document of your billing history by "Generate Billing History" within the Billing page of the console.

### Why are my GPUs not showing up in the list?

There are over 10,000\+ listings on vast, and search only displays a small subset. You will usually not be able to find any one specific machine through most normal searches. To test that your machine is listed correctly, you can use the CLI:
vastai search offers 'machine_id=12345 verified=any'

Replace 12345 with your actual machine ID
If your machine is verified, you should still be able to find it without the verified=any.

[Use the CLI (preferred)](/cli/get-started)
