## What is Vast.ai?

Vast.ai is a cloud computing, matchmaking, and aggregation service focused on lowering the price of compute-intensive workloads. Our software allows anyone to easily become a host by renting out their hardware. Our web search interface allows users to quickly find the best deals for compute according to their specific requirements.

## How does Vast.ai work?

Hosts download and run our management software, list their machines, configure prices, and set any default jobs. Clients then find suitable machines using our flexible search interface, rent their desired machines, and finally run commands or start SSH sessions with a few clicks.

## What are Vast's advantages?

Vast.ai provides a simple interface to rent powerful machines at the best possible prices, reducing GPU cloud computing costs by ~3x to 5x. Consumer computers and consumer GPUs, in particular, are considerably more cost-effective than equivalent enterprise hardware. We are helping the millions of underutilized consumer GPUs around the world enter the cloud computing market for the first time.

## What is the Secure Cloud filter?

The "Secure Cloud (Only Trusted Datacenters)" filter shows only vetted datacenter providers. These partners have their equipment in certified locations that are current with [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) and/or [Tier 3/4](https://uptimeinstitute.com/tiers) standards. 

Vast.ai has verified that this equipment is in these facilities and that their certifications are up to date. For sensitive or production workloads, we recommend checking the "secure cloud" filter. Look for the blue datacenter label.

## What operating systems are provided?

Vast currently provides **Linux Docker instances only**, mostly Ubuntu-based. We do not support Windows.

## What interfaces are available?

Currently, Vast.ai provides:
- **SSH access** for terminal/command line control
- **Jupyter** for notebook interfaces with GUI  
- **Command-only** instance mode for automated workloads
- **Instance Portal** for web-based access

We do not provide remote desktop interfaces.
