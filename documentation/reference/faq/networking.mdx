### How can I open custom ports?

Add -p arguments in the docker create/run options box in the template configuration or image config editor pop-up menu. To open ports 8081 and 8082, use something like this:

```text
-p 8081:8081 -p 8082:8082
```

This will result in additional arguments to docker create/run to expose those internal ports, which will be mapped to random external ports. Any ports exposed in these docker options are in addition to ports exposed through EXPOSE commands in the docker image, and the ports 22 or 8080 which may be opened automatically for SSH or Jupyter.

After the instance has loaded, you can find the corresponding external public IP by opening the IP Port Info pop-up (button on top of the instance) and then looking for something like:

```text
65.130.162.74:33526 -> 8081/tcp
```

In this case, the public IP 65.130.162.74:33526 can be used to access anything you run on port 8081 inside the instance. As a simple test case, you can run a simple minimal web browser inside the instance with the following command:

```text
python -m http.server 8081
```

Which you would then access in this example by loading 65.130.162.74:33526 in your web browser.

### How can I open an identity port map like 32001:32001 where external are the same?

Just use an out-of-range port above 70000:

```text
-p 70000:70000 -p 70001:70001
```
