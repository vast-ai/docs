This page allows to view and manage team members and their roles. More on that [here](https://docs.vast.ai/teams-roles). To create a team, follow this [guide](https://docs.vast.ai/teams-quickstart).

# Page Walkthrough

Here's an example of what a Members page would look like in the console.

You can change a role by clicking on directional arrow and selecting a new role.

<Frame caption="Roles">

</Frame>

You can also remove a teammate by clicking on 'Delete', which will trigger a pop-up.

<Frame caption="Remove Member">

As you can see from the images, this Members console page easily allows you to view and manage the current state of your team.
