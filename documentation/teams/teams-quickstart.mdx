## Introduction

This quickstart guide will walk you through how to create a team, invite new team members and assign them to different roles.

## Creating the Team

There are two ways to create a team:

1. Click on your profile name (or email address) in the Context Switcher and then click the **Create Team** button
2. Or you can navigate to the **Members** section in the Sidebar and click **Create Team**

</Frame>

Once there, you can create your **Team Name** and transfer some credit to your team during creation. You can also skip the credit transfer step and do it later from the [**Billing Page**](/documentation/reference/billing#a6bsE).

To add credit during team creation, select **Transfer my personal credits** checkbox, enter an amount, and then click **Create**.

After successfully creating the team you should see your Team Name and role in the Context Switcher in the upper left corner and the Team Dashboard on the **Members** page.

</Frame>

The **Members** section is the main way that team owners and managers can interact with the Teams ecosystem. From here you can invite team members, create/manage team roles, remove team members, etc.

## Managing Team Roles

Every team comes with two default roles: manager and member.

Managers have full access to team resources, while members have limited read access to most resources while still being able to rent instances. [Learn more.](/documentation/teams/teams-roles)

To create a new role with your desired permissions, navigate to the **Roles** tab of the **Members** **Page**. Then you can name the role and choose the permission groups that the new role will have access to. Once you are satisfied, click **Generate** to create the new role.

For more information on Permission Groups and what they allow access to, [click here](/api-reference/permissions-and-authorization).

## Inviting Team Members

To invite a team member, go to the **Members Page** and click on the **Invite** button.

This will bring up a quick popup where you can enter the email and team role for the person you want to invite. Once complete, click **Invite** to send the invitation email.

</Frame>

Once you send the invitation, the user should get an email asking them to join your team. Upon clicking the link in the email they will be added as a member of your team.

**Note:** if the recipient of the invitation does not have a Vast account, they will need to create one before being added to your Team.

Once the invitee has joined your team, you should see them listed in the **Members** section.

## Using SSH Keys with Team Instances

If you are part of a **team** and want to connect to a **teamâ€™s instance** using SSH, simply add your key to your individual account keys. Hereâ€™s how it works depending on the type of instance:

ðŸ”¹ VM Instances

- Your SSH key **must be added to your personal account before the VM is created**.
- When the VM is launched, all SSH keys in your account are automatically included for access a team instance.

ðŸ”¹ Non-VM Instances

- You can either:
  - **Add your SSH key directly to the instance**, or
  - **Add your key to your personal account**, in which case it will be automatically applied to the team instance as well.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully created a team\!

From this point, you can add any Billing information the same way as a regular account and invite as many of your teammates as you like so you can collaborate together with ease.
