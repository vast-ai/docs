## A Note on Legacy Team Creation

Originally, the process of creating a team involved converting a user's personal account into a special team account. This has now been updated so that, users can create teams within the Vast.ai platform that are completely separate from their personal account. This document explains the key aspects of the new process and its implications for team management and access.

### Implications of Team Account Creation

- **Switching Between Context:** Users can switch between their personal and team accounts via the Context Switcher, making it easier to manage multiple environments.
- **Dedicated Team Credit and Balance:** Team accounts now have their own separate credit and balance, distinct from personal accounts. This ensures that billing and resource allocation are independent between personal and team activities.
- **Role-Based Access for Team Members**: When new members are added to the team, they are granted access to the shared team account based on the role assigned to them. The roles themselves determine their level of access/control over the team's resources. Actions made in the Team Context are applied to the Team as whole.

### Considerations

- **Clear Communication with Team Members**: Ensure that all team members are aware of the nature of the team account and their respective roles and permissions.
- **No Ownership Transfer Mechanism**: Currently, there is no feature to change the ownership of the team. The original creator of the team will remain the owner for the duration of the team account's existence until this functionality is added.
- **Plan for Team Management**: Since team ownership cannot yet be transferred, please plan accordingly for long-term management and control of the team account.

By introducing separate team accounts, Vast.ai is providing users with greater flexibility in managing both personal and team-based projects, ensuring a clearer distinction between individual and shared resources.

### Reminders for Legacy Team Accounts

- **Irreversible Process**: Once a user account has been converted into a team account, the change is permanent and cannot be reversed.
- **Inheritance of Account Attributes**: The converted team account inherits all aspects of your existing personal account, including billing information, cloud services, and any other account settings.
