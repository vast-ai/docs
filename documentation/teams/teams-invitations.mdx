### Sending Team Invitations

1. **Accessing Invitation Feature**: Team managers and owners can send invitations from the Team Members page on the Vast.ai platform or by using the Vast CLI Tool.
2. **Entering Email Addresses**: To invite a new member in the UI, enter their email address in the invitation section. Then, select the role you want them to join as.
3. **Sending the Invitation**: Once the email address is entered and the role is set, click **Invite**. An email with a unique invitation link will be sent to the invitee.

Anyone with the proper permissions (currently **team\_write**) can send invitations to invite team members at any role level.

### Accepting Team Invitations

1. **Receiving the Invitation Email**: Invitees will receive an email containing a unique team invitation link.&#x20;
2. **Completing the Joining Process**: Clicking the link will initiate a set of operations to add the invitee to the team. This may involve signing into the Vast.ai platform or creating an account if necessary.
3. **Confirmation of Membership**: Once the process is complete, the new member will be officially added to the team and will have access based on their role.

### Best Practices

- **Ensure Accurate Email Address**: Double-check the email address before sending invitations to avoid any miscommunication.
- **Communicate with Invitees**: Inform potential team members that they will be receiving an invitation and what steps they need to follow.
- **Follow-up on Pending Invitations**: Keep track of sent invitations and follow up with invitees who haven't joined yet. **Note:&#x20;**&#x54;eam Inivitations will expire after **4 hours.**
