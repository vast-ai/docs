### Delete a Team

Only the Team Owner can delete a team.&#x20;
To delete a team, open the same three-dot menu on the Members page and select 'Delete team'. Make sure you have deleted all instances from the Instances page, or all machines from the Machines page (if you are a host), before proceeding.
