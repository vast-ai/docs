The Transfer Team Ownership feature allows an owner to seamlessly reassign the team to another member within it. To do so, navigate to the **Members** page and click three-dot menu in the upper right corner.

From there, you can click **Transfer Team Ownership** and open a pop-up, select a new owner (who must already be a member of the team), and confirm the transfer. Once confirmed, ownership will be reassigned, and your role will be changed to a manager.
