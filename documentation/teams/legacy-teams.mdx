## Overview

Originally, the process of creating a team involved converting a user's personal account into a special team account. This legacy method has now been replaced with the ability to create separate team accounts.

### Reminders for Legacy Team Accounts

- **Irreversible Process**: Once a user account has been converted into a team account, the change is permanent and cannot be reversed.
- **Inheritance of Account Attributes**: The converted team account inherits all aspects of your existing personal account, including billing information, cloud services, and any other account settings.
