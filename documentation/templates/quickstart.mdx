## Run Your First Template

To jump right in and run a template, follow these steps.

Visit the templates section of the console where you will find all of our recommended templates.

<Frame caption="Recommended Templates">
![Recommended Templates page](/images/console-templates.webp)
</Frame>

Browse through the templates until you find one that meets your requirements.  In this guide we will use NVIDIA CUDA, which is the first on the list. It's a great starter template as it just includes the CUDA development environment, plus a few extras to improve the user experience.

<Frame caption="NVIDIA CUDA Template">

</Frame>

Now, click the 'play' button.  This will load the template and take you to the available offers.

<Frame caption="Offers page with GPU filter active">
![Offers page with GPU filter active](/images/console-templates-3.webp)
</Frame>

There are filters available at the top of the page to help you target a particular GPU.  You will also find many additional filters on the left of the page for more fine-grained control over the instances you find.

When you have found a suitable offer, simply click the 'RENT' button to create your new instance.

You can now visit [cloud.vast.ai/instances](https://cloud.vast.ai/instances/) where you will find your running instance.  It may take a few minutes to be ready as everything is being set up.

</Frame>

When it is ready you will see the blue open button.  This indicates that the instance is ready to connect.

<Note>
  The action of the open button depends on the template you have chosen - In this example you will be transferred to the [Instance Portal](/documentation/instances/instance-portal). To learn how to configure Instance Portal links, see our [Advanced Setup](/documentation/templates/advanced-setup#portal-config) guide.
