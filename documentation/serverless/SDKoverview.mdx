The Vast Serverless SDK is a Python `pip` package that provides tools for both **creating serverless endpoints** and **sending and managing requests** to those endpoints. It abstracts much of the complexity of interacting with the serverless engine and individual workers.

## What the SDK Handles

The SDK manages the following core functions for the client:

- **Authentication**
- **All communication** between the client, endpoints, and individual workers
- **Request queuing**
- **Error handling and retries**
- **Creating and managing asynchronous sessions**
- **Providing worker status and lifecycle information**

## Why Use the SDK

While there are other ways to interact with serverless endpoint—such as the CLI and the REST API—the SDK is the **most powerful and easiest** method to use. It is the recommended approach for most applications due to its higher-level abstractions, reliability, and ease of integration into Python-based workflows.

If the Python SDK is not usable for your application, please contact support to request further assistance. We're happy to help.
