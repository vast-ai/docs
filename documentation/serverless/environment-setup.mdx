## Environment Variables

### Setting User Environment Variables

Navigate to the [account settings page](https://cloud.vast.ai/account/) and expand the "Environment Variables" tab.

#### Common Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `HF_TOKEN` | HuggingFace access token for gated models | `hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for compatible services | `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `WANDB_API_KEY` | Weights & Biases tracking | `wandb_xxxxxxxxxxxxx` |

To add a variable:
1. Enter the key name (e.g., `HF_TOKEN`)
2. Enter the value (your actual token)
3. Click the "+" button
4. Click "Save Edits"

<Warning>
  Environment variables set here will be available to all your serverless workers. Keep sensitive tokens secure and rotate them regularly.
</Warning>

### Template Environment Variables

When creating or editing a template, you can set model-specific environment variables:

- `MODEL_NAME` - The HuggingFace model ID or path
- `QUANTIZATION` - Quantization method (e.g., `awq`, `gptq`, `bitsandbytes`)
- `MAX_MODEL_LEN` - Maximum context length
- `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` - GPU memory allocation (0.0-1.0)

## SSL Certificate Installation

Vast.ai serverless workers use SSL by default with self-signed certificates. For production use, install the root certificate to avoid SSL warnings.

### Python Clients

1. Download Vast AI's certificate:
```bash
curl -O https://console.vast.ai/static/jvastai_root.cer
```

2. Use the certificate in your requests:
```python
import requests

# Specify the certificate path for each request
response = requests.post(
    "https://worker-url/v1/chat/completions",
    json=payload,
    verify='/path/to/jvastai_root.cer'
)
```

This approach only affects Vast.ai requests and won't interfere with other services.

### Browser Installation

For web-based clients or browser testing:

#### Chrome/Edge
1. Go to Settings → Privacy and Security → Security
2. Click "Manage certificates"
3. Go to the "Authorities" tab
4. Click "Import" and select `jvastai_root.cer`

#### Firefox
1. Go to Settings → Privacy & Security
2. Scroll to "Certificates" section
3. Click "View Certificates"
4. Go to "Authorities" tab
5. Click "Import" and select `jvastai_root.cer`

#### Safari (macOS)
1. Double-click the downloaded `jvastai_root.cer` file
2. Keychain Access will open
3. Add to "System" keychain
4. Right-click the certificate and select "Get Info"
5. Expand "Trust" and set to "Always Trust"

### Node.js Clients

For Node.js applications, set the environment variable:
```bash
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/path/to/jvastai_root.cer
```

Or in your application:
```javascript
process.env.NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS = '/path/to/jvastai_root.cer';
```

### Disabling SSL (Development Only)

If you prefer to disable SSL verification during development:

#### Python
```python
import urllib3
urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

# In requests
response = requests.post(url, verify=False)
```

#### cURL
```bash
curl -k https://worker-url/v1/chat/completions
```

#### Node.js
```javascript
process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = '0';
```

<Warning>
  Never disable SSL verification in production. Always use proper certificate installation for secure communications.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate Errors
- **"SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED"**: Certificate not installed correctly
- **"Self-signed certificate"**: Need to install Vast's root certificate
- **"Certificate expired"**: Download the latest certificate

### Environment Variable Issues
- Variables not appearing: Ensure you clicked "Save Edits" after adding
- Token authentication failures: Verify token is valid and has correct permissions
- Variables not updating: Workers may need to be restarted to pick up changes
