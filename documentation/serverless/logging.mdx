Endpoint and worker logs provide real-time visibility into the behavior of your serverless infrastructure. These logs are primarily intended for debugging issues with endpoints, workergroups, and individual workers.

## Endpoint Logs

Endpoint logs are available under the **"All Workergroups"** tab in the Serverless endpoint, within the Vast console UI.

These logs include low-level details about scaling decisions made by the serverless engine. They are useful for understanding how the system responds to traffic and workload changes, and include:
- Summarized performance for all workers and workergroups
- Measured and estimated performance and worker load
- Marketplace offer details used in worker recruitment

## Worker Logs

Worker logs are accessible on a per-worker basis. To view worker logs, navigate to the serverless endpoint in question and click on this icon next to the worker.

Worker logs provide detailed runtime output for individual workers, helping you debug model loading, request handling, container behavior, and other worker-specific events.

## Log Characteristics and Retention

- Logs are **streaming outputs**, typically only a few seconds behind real-time.
- Logs are **not permanently maintained** and are intended for near real-time debugging of issues.
- Users who need longer retention should **periodically download logs** to store them externally.

## Accessing Logs Through the CLI

In addition to accessing these logs through the UI, you can use the vastai CLI to check endpoint and worker group logs at different log levels (level 0 is the highest detail, level 3 the lowest).

## Endpoint logs
```cli CLI Command
vastai get endpt-logs <endpoint_id> --level (0-3)
```

## Workergroup logs
```cli CLI Command
vastai get wrkgrp-logs <worker_group_id> --level (0-3)
```
