The parameters below are specific to only Workergroups, not Endpoints. Pre-configured serverless templates from Vast will have these values already set.

## `gpu_ram`

The amount of GPU memory (VRAM) in gigabytes that your model or workload requires to run. This parameter tells the serverless engine how much GPU memory your model needs.

If not specified during Workergroup creation, the default value is `24`.

## `launch_args`

A command-line style string containing additional parameters for instance creation that will be parsed and applied when the serverless engine creates new workers. This allows you to customize instance configuration beyond what’s specified in templates.

There is no default value for `launch_args`.

## `search_params`

A query string, list, or dictionary that specifies the hardware and performance criteria for filtering GPU offers in the vast.ai marketplace. It uses a simple query syntax to define requirements for the machines that your Workergroup will consider when searching for workers to create.

Example (Python):

```python icon="python" Python
{"verified": {"eq": true}, "rentable": {"eq": true}, "rented": {"eq": false}}
```

There is no default value for `search_params`. To see all available search filters, see the CLI docs.

## `template_hash`

A unique hexadecimal identifier that references a pre-configured template containing all the configuration needed to create instances. Templates are comprehensive specifications that include the Docker image, environment variables, onstart scripts, resource requirements, and other deployment settings.

There is no default value for `template_hash`.

## `template_id`

A numeric (integer) identifier that uniquely references a template in the Vast.ai database. This is an alternative way to reference the same template that `template_hash` points to, but using the template’s database primary key instead of its hash string.

There is no default value for `template_id`.
