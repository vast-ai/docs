Vast Serverless is an AI infrastructure platform that lets you run compute-intensive workloads without managing GPUs, paying for execution rather than GPU rental time. It is best suited for bursty workloads such as on-demand inference, batch jobs, and other usage patterns with variable or unpredictable demand. Interacting with Vast Serverless is made easy through a powerful python SDK.

In addition to the standard benefits of using a serverless infrastructure, Vast Serverless provides further cost optimization through benchmarking to take advantage of the most cost-efficient GPUs in Vast’s marketplace.

This enables better, more-cost effective scaling, but does require an evaluation period for each newly created endpoint to benchmark each workload against different GPU classes.

## Unique Features

- **Benchmark-driven scaling**: Automatic identification and recruitment of the best price-performance GPU to scale your unique workload.
- **One endpoint, mixed hardware**: Automatically leverage Vast’s wide fleet of GPUs (from consumer-grade to the highest-end GPUs) to serve your needs, with a minimum of overhead.
- **Fine-grain control and transparency**: Precise configurability and observability over your infrastructure gives unmatched control.

This guide introduces users to Vast Serverless concepts and best practices on how to achieve optimal configuration for your application.
