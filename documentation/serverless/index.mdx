Use Vast.ai's Serverless system to automate the provisioning of GPU workers to match the dynamic computational needs of your workloads. This system ensures efficient and cost-effective scaling for AI inference and other GPU computing tasks.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically scale your AI inference up or down based on customizable performance metrics.
- **Global GPU Fleet**: Leverage Vast’s global fleet of powerful, affordable GPUs for your computational needs.
- **Fast Cold-Start Times**: Minimize cold-start times with a reserve pool of workers that can spin up in seconds.
- **Metrics and Debugging**: Access ample metrics and debugging tools for your serverless usage, including logs and Jupyter/SSH access.
- **Performance Exploration**: Perform in-depth performance exploration to optimize based on performance and price metrics.
- **Custom Worker Types**: Define custom worker types through CLI search filters and create commands, supporting multiple worker types per endpoint.
