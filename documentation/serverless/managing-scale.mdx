## Managing for Bursty Load

- **Adjust** `min_workers`: This will change the number of managed inactive workers, and increase capacity for high peak
- **Increase** `cold_mult`: This will change the rate (and in extreme cases, the number) of worker recruitment. Use this to manage for fast transitions in demand
- **Check** `max_workers`: Ensure this parameter is set high enough for the serverless engine to create the necessary number of workers

## Managing for Low Demand or Idle Periods

- **Adjust** `min_load`: Reducing `min_load` will reduce the minimum number of active workers. Set to `1` to reduce the number to its minimum value of 1 worker
- **Adjust** `min_workers`: This will change the number of managed inactive workers
