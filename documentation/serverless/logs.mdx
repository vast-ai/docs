title: Logs
description: Learn how to fetch and analyze logs from Vast.ai Serverless endpoints and worker groups. Understand the log levels, how to use cURL to fetch logs, and how to interpret the logs for debugging and performance monitoring.
---

Both Endpoints and Worker Groups keep logs that can be fetched by using the `/get_endpoint_logs/` and `/get_autogroup_logs/` endpoints, respectively.

Endpoint logs relate to managing instances, and Worker Group logs relate to searching for offers to create instances from, as well as calls to create instances using the offers.&#x20;

For both types of groups, there are four levels of logs with decreasing levels of detail: **debug**, **trace**, **info0**, and **info1**.

<Warning>
  Each log level has a fixed size, and once it is full, the log is wiped and overwritten with new log messages. It is good practice to check these regularly while debugging.

# POST https\://run.vast.ai/get\_endpoint\_logs/

## Inputs

- One of the following:
  - `id`(int): ID of your endpoint
  - `endpoint`(string): Name of your endpoint
- `api_key`(string): The Vast API key associated with the account that controls the Endpoint.

```json JSON icon="js"
{
    "endpoint": "YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME",
    "api_key": "YOUR_VAST_API_KEY"
}
```

## Outputs

- `info0`: The contents of the `info0` log
- `info1`: The contents of the `info1` log
- `trace`: The contents of the `trace` log
- `debug`: The contents of the `debug` log

## Example: Fetching Endpoint Logs with cURL

```curl Curl icon="cube"
curl https://run.vast.ai/get_endpoint_logs/ \
-X POST \
-d '{"endpoint" : 123, "api_key" : "API_KEY_HERE"}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

***

# POST https\://run.vast.ai/get\_autogroup\_logs/

## Inputs

- `id`(int): The ID of the Worker Group
- `api_key`(string): The Vast API key associated with the account that controls the Worker Group.

```json JSON icon="js"
{
    "id": 1001,
    "api_key": "YOUR_VAST_API_KEY"
}
```

## Outputs

- `info0`: The contents of the `info0` log
- `info1`: The contents of the `info1` log
- `trace`: The contents of the `trace` log
- `debug`: The contents of the `debug` log

## Example: Fetching Worker Group Logs with cURL

```bash Bash
curl https://run.vast.ai/get_autogroup_logs/ \
-X POST \
-d '{"id" : 1001, "api_key" : "API_KEY_HERE"}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

<Warning>
  In some cases `info0` may not contain logs for a Worker Group.
