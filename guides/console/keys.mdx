The Keys page helps you manage secure access to your Vast.ai account. Here, you’ll find different types of keys used for authentication and connection.&#x20;

## Session Keys

A **session key** is a temporary key that allows access to your Vast.ai account. These keys are automatically created when you log in and will expire in one week.

However, for security reasons, it's important to review your session keys regularly. You can view a list of all active session keys and see which devices are currently logged into your account. If you notice any session keys that you don’t recognize, or if a device is no longer in use, you can delete those keys to immediately remove access. This helps keep your account secure and ensures only your devices remain connected.

## SSH Keys

You can add, edit, or remove your ssh keys in the SSH Keys section of the Keys page of your console.

Once the SSH key is saved, it will appear in the SSH Keys section and will be automatically added to your future instances.

## API Keys
