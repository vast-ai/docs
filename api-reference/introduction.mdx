<Warning>
**The raw REST API is intended for advanced users only.** These endpoints offer maximum flexibility but require you to manage all aspects of integration yourself. Most users will have a significantly better experience using the [CLI](/cli/get-started) or the [Python SDK](/sdk/python/quickstart), which handle these details for you. **If you are not sure whether you need direct API access, you almost certainly don't** — start with the CLI or SDK instead.
</Warning>

Welcome to Vast.ai's API documentation. Our API allows you to programmatically manage GPU instances, handle machine operations, and automate your AI/ML workflow. Whether you're running individual GPU instances or managing a fleet of machines, our API provides comprehensive control over all Vast.ai platform features.
