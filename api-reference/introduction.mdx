<Warning>
**The raw REST API is intended for advanced users only.** These endpoints offer maximum flexibility but require you to manage all aspects of integration yourself. Most users will have a significantly better experience using the [CLI](/cli/get-started) or the [Python SDK](/sdk/python/quickstart), which handle these details for you. **If you are not sure whether you need direct API access, you almost certainly don't** — start with the CLI or SDK instead.
</Warning>

The Vast.ai REST API gives you programmatic access to the entire platform — authentication, account management, billing, GPU search, instance lifecycle, templates, volumes, serverless endpoints, and team administration. Anything you can do in the web console, you can automate through the API.

This guide walks through the core workflow: authenticate, search for a GPU, rent it, wait for it to boot, connect to it, and clean up. By the end you'll understand the API calls needed to manage instances without touching the web console.

## Prerequisites

- A Vast.ai account with credit (~$0.01–0.05, depending on test instance run time)
- `curl` installed
- `python3` with the `requests` library (for the Python examples)

## 1. Get Your API Key

Generate an API key from the [Keys page](https://cloud.vast.ai/cli/keys/) by clicking **+New**. Copy the key — you'll need it for your API calls, and you'll only see it once.

Export it as an environment variable:

```bash
export VAST_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

<Tip>
The console creates a full-access key by default. You can also create scoped API keys with limited permissions via `POST /api/v0/auth/apikeys/` — useful for CI/CD or shared tooling where you want to restrict access to read-only or instance-only operations. See the [Create API Key](/api-reference/accounts/create-api-key) endpoint for details.
</Tip>

## 2. Verify Authentication

Confirm your key works by fetching your account info. This returns your user ID, email, balance, and SSH key — a quick way to verify what your key grants access to.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAST_API_KEY" \
  "https://console.vast.ai/api/v0/users/current/"
```

```python Python
import os
import requests

VAST_API_KEY = os.environ["VAST_API_KEY"]
BASE_URL = "https://console.vast.ai/api/v0"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {VAST_API_KEY}"}

resp = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/users/current/", headers=headers)
print(resp.json())
```
</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "id": 123456,
  "email": "you@example.com",
  "credit": 25.00,
  "ssh_key": "ssh-rsa AAAAB3..."
}
```

The `credit` field shows your available credit, and `ssh_key` is the public key that will be injected into new instances.

<Note>
If you get a `401` or `403`, double-check your API key.
</Note>

## 3. Search for GPUs

Find available machines using the bundles endpoint. This query returns the top 5 on-demand RTX 4090s sorted by deep learning performance benchmarked per dollar:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAST_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "verified": {"eq": true},
    "rentable": {"eq": true},
    "gpu_name": {"eq": "RTX 4090"},
    "num_gpus": {"eq": 1},
    "direct_port_count": {"gte": 1},
    "order": [["dlperf_per_dphtotal", "desc"]],
    "type": "on-demand",
    "limit": 5
  }' \
  "https://console.vast.ai/api/v0/bundles/"
```

```python Python
search_params = {
    "verified": {"eq": True},
    "rentable": {"eq": True},
    "gpu_name": {"eq": "RTX 4090"},
    "num_gpus": {"eq": 1},
    "direct_port_count": {"gte": 1},
    "order": [["dlperf_per_dphtotal", "desc"]],
    "type": "on-demand",
    "limit": 5,
}

resp = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/bundles/", headers=headers, json=search_params)
offers = resp.json()["offers"]
for offer in offers:
    print(f"ID: {offer['id']}  GPU: {offer['gpu_name']}  $/hr: {offer['dph_total']}")
```
</CodeGroup>

Each parameter in the query above controls a different filter:

| Parameter | Value | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `verified` | `{"eq": true}` | Only machines verified by Vast.ai (identity-checked hosts) |
| `rentable` | `{"eq": true}` | Only machines currently available to rent |
| `gpu_name` | `{"eq": "RTX 4090"}` | Filter to a specific GPU model |
| `num_gpus` | `{"eq": 1}` | Exactly 1 GPU per instance |
| `direct_port_count` | `{"gte": 1}` | At least 1 directly accessible port (needed for SSH) |
| `order` | `[["dlperf_per_dphtotal", "desc"]]` | Sort by deep learning performance per dollar, best value first |
| `type` | `"on-demand"` | On-demand pricing (vs. interruptible spot/bid) |
| `limit` | `5` | Return at most 5 results |

The response contains an `offers` array. Note the `id` of the offer you want — you'll use it in the next step. If no offers are returned, try relaxing your filters (e.g. a different GPU model or removing `direct_port_count`).

<Tip>
See the [Search Offers](/api-reference/search/search-offers) reference for the full list of filter parameters and operators.
</Tip>

## 4. Create an Instance

Rent the machine by sending a PUT request to the asks endpoint. Replace `OFFER_ID` with the `id` from step 3.

The simplest approach is to create from a **template**, which bundles your image, startup commands, and launch settings into a reusable configuration:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAST_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X PUT \
  -d '{
    "template_hash_id": "YOUR_TEMPLATE_HASH",
    "disk": 20,
    "runtype": "ssh_direct"
  }' \
  "https://console.vast.ai/api/v0/asks/OFFER_ID/"
```

<Tip>
A template packages your Docker image, environment variables, and startup script so you don't repeat them on every create call. See the [Templates API guide](/api-reference/creating-and-using-templates-with-api) for creating and managing templates.
</Tip>

If you don't have a template yet, you can specify the image and startup commands directly:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAST_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X PUT \
  -d '{
    "image": "pytorch/pytorch:2.4.0-cuda12.4-cudnn9-runtime",
    "disk": 20,
    "onstart": "echo hello && nvidia-smi",
    "runtype": "ssh_direct"
  }' \
  "https://console.vast.ai/api/v0/asks/OFFER_ID/"
```

```python Python
offer_id = offers[0]["id"]  # from step 3

create_params = {
    "image": "pytorch/pytorch:2.4.0-cuda12.4-cudnn9-runtime",
    "disk": 20,
    "onstart": "echo hello && nvidia-smi",
    "runtype": "ssh_direct",
}

resp = requests.put(
    f"{BASE_URL}/asks/{offer_id}/", headers=headers, json=create_params
)
result = resp.json()
print(result)
```
</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "new_contract": 12345678,
  "instance_api_key": "d15a..."
}
```

Save the `new_contract` value — this is your instance ID. The `instance_api_key` provides scoped access for that specific instance (e.g., querying `GET /api/v0/instances/{id}/` without your main API key).

<Note>
Setting `"runtype": "ssh_direct"` gives you a direct SSH connection to the machine, which has lower latency than the default proxy SSH. Recommended for interactive work.
</Note>

## 5. Wait Until Ready

The instance needs time to pull the Docker image and boot. Poll the status endpoint until `actual_status` is `"running"`. Replace `INSTANCE_ID` with the `new_contract` value from step 4.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAST_API_KEY" \
  "https://console.vast.ai/api/v0/instances/INSTANCE_ID/"
```

```python Python
import time

instance_id = result["new_contract"]

while True:
    resp = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/instances/{instance_id}/", headers=headers)
    instance = resp.json()["instances"]
    if instance is None:
        print("Status: provisioning")
        time.sleep(10)
        continue
    status = instance.get("actual_status")
    print(f"Status: {status}")
    if status == "running":
        break
    time.sleep(10)

print(f"SSH: ssh -p {instance['ssh_port']} root@{instance['ssh_host']}")
```
</CodeGroup>

Example response:

```json
{
  "instances": {
    "actual_status": "loading",
    "ssh_host": "...",
    "ssh_port": 12345
  }
}
```

The `actual_status` field progresses through these states:

| `actual_status` | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| `null` | Instance is being provisioned |
| `"loading"` | Docker image is downloading |
| `"running"` | Ready to use |

Poll every 10 seconds. Boot time is typically 1–5 minutes depending on the Docker image size. You can also use the `onstart` script to send a callback when the instance is ready, instead of polling.

This endpoint returns extensive instance details (hardware specs, pricing, networking, utilization metrics, and more). See the [Show Instance](/api-reference/instances/show-instance) endpoint for the full field reference.

Once `actual_status` is `"running"`, you're ready to connect. Since we set `runtype` to `ssh_direct` in step 4, this is a direct connection to the machine.

## 6. Connect via SSH

Use the `ssh_host` and `ssh_port` from the status response to connect directly to your new instance:

```bash
ssh root@SSH_HOST -p SSH_PORT
```

## 7. Clean Up

When you're done, destroy the instance to stop all billing.

Alternatively, to pause an instance temporarily instead of destroying it, you can **stop** it. Stopping halts compute billing but disk storage charges continue.

**Destroy** (removes everything):

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAST_API_KEY" \
  -X DELETE \
  "https://console.vast.ai/api/v0/instances/INSTANCE_ID/"
```

```python Python
resp = requests.delete(f"{BASE_URL}/instances/{instance_id}/", headers=headers)
print(resp.json())
```
</CodeGroup>

**Stop** (pauses compute, disk charges continue):

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAST_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X PUT \
  -d '{"state": "stopped"}' \
  "https://console.vast.ai/api/v0/instances/INSTANCE_ID/"
```

```python Python
resp = requests.put(
    f"{BASE_URL}/instances/{instance_id}/",
    headers=headers,
    json={"state": "stopped"},
)
print(resp.json())
```
</CodeGroup>

Both return `{"success": true}`.

## Next Steps

You've now completed the full instance lifecycle through the API: authentication, search, creation, polling, and teardown. From here:

- **SSH setup** — See the [SSH guide](/documentation/instances/connect/ssh) for key configuration and advanced connection options.
- **Use templates** — Avoid repeating image and config parameters on every create call. The [Templates API guide](/api-reference/creating-and-using-templates-with-api) covers creating, sharing, and launching from templates.
