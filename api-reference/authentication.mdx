Every request to the Vast.ai API must include an API key. This page covers how to create keys, how to include them in requests, and key lifecycle details.

## Create an API Key

Generate a key from the [Keys page](https://cloud.vast.ai/cli/keys/) in the web console:

1. Click **+New**.
2. Give the key a name (optional but recommended — e.g. "CI pipeline" or "notebook").
3. Copy the key immediately — you'll only see it once.

<Tip>
You can also create keys programmatically via the API ([Create API Key](/api-reference/accounts/create-api-key)), CLI ([`vastai create api-key`](/cli/reference/create-api-key)), or SDK ([`vast.create_api_key()`](/sdk/python/reference/create-api-key)).
</Tip>

## Use an API Key

Include your key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAST_API_KEY" \
  "https://console.vast.ai/api/v0/users/current/"
```

```python Python
import os
import requests

headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['VAST_API_KEY']}"}
resp = requests.get("https://console.vast.ai/api/v0/users/current/", headers=headers)
print(resp.json())
```
</CodeGroup>

A common pattern is to store your key in an environment variable:

```bash
export VAST_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

This keeps the key out of your code and makes it easy to rotate.

<Note>
If you get a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` response, double-check your API key. The most common causes are a typo, an expired key, or a scoped key that lacks the required permission for the endpoint you're calling.
</Note>

## Verify Your Key

A quick way to confirm your key works is to fetch your account info:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $VAST_API_KEY" \
  "https://console.vast.ai/api/v0/users/current/"
```

A successful response includes your user ID, email, balance, and SSH key:

```json
{
  "id": 123456,
  "email": "you@example.com",
  "credit": 25.00,
  "ssh_key": "ssh-rsa AAAAB3..."
}
```

## Scoped Keys and Permissions

By default, the web console creates a **full-access** key. For CI/CD pipelines, shared tooling, or team environments, you should create **scoped keys** that restrict access to only the permissions you need.

For example, a key that can only read and manage instances (but cannot access billing):

```json
{
  "api": {
    "misc": {},
    "user_read": {},
    "instance_read": {},
    "instance_write": {}
  }
}
```

See the [Permissions](/api-reference/permissions) page for the full list of permission categories, endpoint mappings, constraint syntax, and advanced examples.

## Key Expiration

API keys do not expire by default. You can revoke a key at any time from the [Keys page](https://cloud.vast.ai/cli/keys/) or by calling the [Delete API Key](/api-reference/accounts/delete-api-key) endpoint.

<Warning>
Treat your API key like a password. Do not commit keys to version control or share them in plaintext. If a key is compromised, revoke it immediately and create a new one.
</Warning>
