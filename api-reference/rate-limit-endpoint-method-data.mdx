title: "Rate Limits by Endpoint and Method"
---

Vast.ai enforces rate limits per endpoint and method to ensure fair platform usage. These limits apply per API key (or per IP if no key is provided).

Limits are expressed as a minimum interval (threshold) between requests. For example, a 2s threshold means you can make at most 1 request every 2 seconds to that endpoint.

<Note>
These values reflect current defaults and may change. Always check the `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` response headers for the most accurate pacing.

## Example rate limits

The table below shows representative limits across common endpoint categories:

| Endpoint | Method | Threshold (s) | Max Req/min |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| `/api/v0/instances/` | `GET` | 2 | 30 |
| `/api/v0/instances/{id}/` | `PUT` | 1 | 60 |
| `/api/v0/instances/{id}/` | `DELETE` | 3 | 20 |
| `/api/v0/machines/` | `GET` | 2.5 | 24 |
| `/api/v0/volumes/` | `GET` | 2 | 30 |
| `/api/v0/template/` | `GET` | 1.9 | 31 |
| `/api/v0/ssh/` | `GET` | 1 | 60 |
| `/api/v0/invoices` | `GET` | 3 | 20 |
| `/api/v0/secrets/` | `GET` | 5 | 12 |
| `/api/v0/workergroups/` | `GET` | 2 | 30 |

Write-heavy operations (create, update, delete) generally have stricter limits than read operations. If you need higher limits for production usage, contact support with your account details and expected call rates.
