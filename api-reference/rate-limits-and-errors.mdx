title: "Rate Limits and Errors"
---

This page describes how Vast.ai public API errors and rate limits work, along with practical retry guidance.

## Error Responses

Error responses vary slightly by endpoint. The most common error response shape is:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "invalid_args",
  "msg": "Human-readable description of the problem."
}
```

Some endpoints omit the boolean `success`.
Some omit `error` and return only `msg` or `message`.

## Rate Limits

### How rate limits are applied

Vast.ai applies rate limits per endpoint and per identity.

Unlike other services, this is enforced as a **minimum interval between requests** for a given endpoint and identity, and enforcement is not a binary wall, but determined probabalistically.

The identity is determined by: bearer token + session user + `api_key` query param and falls back to client IP.



### Rate limit response and recommended retry behavior

When you hit a rate limit, you will receive **HTTP 429**. The response body will typically return an acceptable threshold number in seconds:

```
API requests too frequent: endpoint threshold=...
```

We recommend you retry your call after the recommended threshold.


### How to reduce rate limit errors

- **Batch requests** where supported, rather than calling many single-item endpoints.
- **Reduce polling**: use longer polling intervals, or cache results client-side.
- **Spread traffic** over time: avoid bursts; use a queue or scheduler.

If you need higher limits for legitimate production usage, contact support with the endpoint(s), your expected call rate, and your account details.
