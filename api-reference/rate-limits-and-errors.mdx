title: "Rate Limits and Errors"
---

This page describes how Vast.ai API errors and rate limits currently work, with practical retry guidance.

## Error Responses

Error responses vary slightly by endpoint. The most common error response shape is:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "invalid_args",
  "msg": "Human-readable description of the problem."
}
```

Some endpoints omit the boolean `success`.
Some omit `error` and return only `msg` or `message`.

## Rate Limits

### How rate limits work

Vast.ai enforces rate limits at multiple levels to ensure fair platform usage:

1. **Infrastructure level (per IP)**: protects against high-volume traffic before it reaches the API.
2. **Account level (per API key)**: a shared request budget across all endpoints for your account.
3. **Endpoint level (per endpoint and method)**: individual limits for each API endpoint and HTTP method.

### Identity and scope

- Rate limits are tracked per API key. If no key is provided, your client IP is used instead.
- Each endpoint and HTTP method combination (e.g., `GET /api/v0/instances/` vs `PUT /api/v0/instances/{id}/`) has its own limit.
- Some endpoints enforce a minimum interval between requests; others use a burst-style limit (max requests in a time window).

### Response headers

For responses where rate-limiting logic is evaluated, the API includes:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`
- `Retry-After` (on `429` responses)

If multiple rate-limit layers apply, headers represent the **most restrictive** active constraint.

### 429 response behavior

When you hit a rate limit, you receive **HTTP 429**. The response body is often plain text (and in some cases JSON) with messages such as:

```
API requests too frequent
```

or

```
API requests too frequent: endpoint threshold=...
```

### Probabilistic output model

The limiter itself is deterministic per request timeline, but if request arrivals are modeled as a random process (Poisson rate `r` requests/second), a useful approximation for threshold-style limits is:

`P(429) = 1 - exp(-r * T)`

Where `T` is the threshold in seconds.

<Note>
This graph is a statistical model to help plan client-side pacing. Actual outcomes depend on real request timing, burst shape, and which limit layer binds first.

### Chart data used

The exact plotted data points are available here:

- [api-rate-limit-probabilistic-output-data.csv](/images/api-rate-limit-probabilistic-output-data.csv)

CSV details:

- Request-rate domain: `0.000` to `5.000` requests/second
- Step size: `0.025` requests/second
- Rows: 201 points (plus header)
- Curves: `T = 0.5s`, `1s`, `2s`, `5s`

Representative points from the plotted data:

| Request rate `r` (req/s) | `P(429)` at `T=0.5s` | `P(429)` at `T=1s` | `P(429)` at `T=2s` | `P(429)` at `T=5s` |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0.0 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |
| 0.5 | 0.2212 | 0.3935 | 0.6321 | 0.9179 |
| 1.0 | 0.3935 | 0.6321 | 0.8647 | 0.9933 |
| 1.5 | 0.5276 | 0.7769 | 0.9502 | 0.9994 |
| 2.0 | 0.6321 | 0.8647 | 0.9817 | 1.0000 |
| 2.5 | 0.7135 | 0.9179 | 0.9933 | 1.0000 |
| 3.0 | 0.7769 | 0.9502 | 0.9975 | 1.0000 |
| 3.5 | 0.8262 | 0.9698 | 0.9991 | 1.0000 |
| 4.0 | 0.8647 | 0.9817 | 0.9997 | 1.0000 |
| 4.5 | 0.8946 | 0.9889 | 0.9999 | 1.0000 |
| 5.0 | 0.9179 | 0.9933 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |

### Endpoint/method limit data

Per-endpoint rate limit data is documented here:

- [Rate Limits by Endpoint and Method](/api-reference/rate-limit-endpoint-method-data)

### How to reduce rate limit errors

- **Batch requests** where supported, rather than calling many single-item endpoints.
- **Reduce polling**: use longer polling intervals, or cache results client-side.
- **Spread traffic** over time: avoid bursts; use a queue or scheduler.
- **Honor headers**: use `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` to pace retries.

If you need higher limits for legitimate production usage, contact support with the endpoint(s), your expected call rate, and your account details.
