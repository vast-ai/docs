# CUDA Programming on Vast.ai

## Introduction

This guide walks you through setting up and running CUDA applications on Vast.ai's cloud platform. You'll learn how to set up a CUDA development environment, connect to your instance, and develop CUDA applications efficiently using NVIDIA's development tools.

## Prerequisites

- A Vast.ai account
- Basic familiarity with CUDA programming concepts
- Basic knowledge of Linux command line
- [(Optional) Install TLS Certificate for Jupyter](/documentation/instances/jupyter)
- [(Optional) SSH client installed on your local machine and SSH public key added the Keys section at cloud.vast.ai](/documentation/instances/sshscp)
- [(Optional) Vast-cli installed on your local machine for command-line management](/cli/get-started)
- [(Optional) Docker knowledge for customizing development environments](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

## Setup

### 1. Selecting the Right Template

Navigate to the [Templates tab](https://cloud.vast.ai/templates/) to view recommended templates.

Search for [NVIDIA CUDA](https://cloud.vast.ai?ref_id=62897&template_id=61e14a0dd1f97aa0aa6719d20bc9b02e) template if:

- You need a standard CUDA development environment
- You want pre-configured security features (TLS, authentication)
- You require Jupyter notebook integration
- You need additional development tools like Tensorboard

[Make a custom CUDA template](/documentation/templates/creating-templates) if:

- You need a specific CUDA or Python version
- You have special library requirements
- You want to minimize image size for faster instance startup

### 2. Edit the Template and Select Template

You can edit the template to use Jupyter launch mode if:&#x20;

- You're behind a corporate firewall that blocks SSH
- You prefer browser-based development
- You want persistent terminal sessions that survive browser disconnects
- You need quick access without SSH client setup
- You want to combine CUDA development with notebook documentation
- You plan to switch between multiple terminal sessions in the browser

You can edit the template to use SSH launch mode if:&#x20;

- You're using [VSCode Remote-SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) or other IDE integrations
- You need lowest possible terminal latency
- You prefer using your local terminal emulator
- You want to use advanced terminal features like tmux
- You're doing extensive command-line development
- You need to transfer files frequently using scp or rsync

### 2. Create Your Instance

Select your desired GPU configuration based on your computational needs from the [Search tab](https://cloud.vast.ai/create/). For CUDA development, consider:&#x20;

- System Requirements:&#x20;
  - RAM: Minimum 16GB for development tools
  - Storage: 10GB is usually sufficient
    - CUDA Toolkit core: \~2GB
    - Development files and builds: \~3-4GB
    - Room for source code and dependencies: \~4GB
  - CPU: 4+ cores recommended for compilation
  - Network: 100+ Mbps for remote development

&#x20;Rent the GPU of your choice.

### 3. Connecting to Your Instance

Go to [Instances tab](https://cloud.vast.ai/instances/) to see your instance being created. There are multiple ways to connect to your instance:

- If Jupyter launch mode is selected in your template:
  - Click the "OPEN" button or "Jupyter" button on your instance card&#x20;
  - Access a full development environment with notebook support
- If you selected SSH launch mode:
  - Click Open Terminal Access button&#x20;
  - Copy Direct ssh connect string contents that looks like this "ssh -p 12345 root\@123.456.789.10 -L 8080\:localhost:8080"
  - You take the ssh command and execute in your terminal in your [Mac or Linux-based computer or in Powershell](/documentation/instances/sshscp)
  - You can use [Powershell or Windows Putty tools](/documentation/instances/sshscp) if you have a Windows computer

## Installation

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. The base environment includes:
   - CUDA toolkit and development tools
   - Python with common ML libraries
   - Development utilities (gcc, make, etc.)
2. Install additional CUDA dependencies:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y cuda-samples
```

### Configuring Your Workspace

1. Navigate to your workspace:

```bash
cd ${WORKSPACE}
```

1. Set up CUDA environment variables:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

CUDA not found:

- Check if GPU is detectable: `nvidia-smi`

```linux
nvidia-smi

```

If output like "No devices were found" shows up,  report the machine after clicking on the wrench icon and rent a different machine.

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

- Code Organization
  - Keep source files in `${WORKSPACE}`
  - Use version control for code management
  - Maintain separate directories for builds and source
- Performance Optimization
  - Use proper CUDA stream management
  - Optimize memory transfers
  - Profile code using NVIDIA tools

## Advanced Topics

### Custom Environment Setup

Create a provisioning script for custom environment setup:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
. /venv/main/bin/activate
pip install additional-packages
wget custom-tools.tar.gz
```

### Remote Development Setup

Configure VS Code or other IDEs for [remote development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh):

- Use SSH port forwarding for secure connections
- Configure development tools to use remote CUDA compiler
- Set up source synchronization using Syncthing

## Conclusion

You now have a fully configured CUDA development environment on Vast.ai. This setup provides the flexibility of cloud GPU resources with the convenience of local development.
