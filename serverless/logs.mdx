Both Endpoints and Worker Groups keep logs that can be fetched by using the `/get_endpoint_logs/` and `/get_autogroup_logs/` endpoints, respectively.

Endpoint logs relate to managing instances, and Worker Group logs relate to searching for offers to create instances from, as well as calls to create instances using the offers.&#x20;

For both types of groups, there are four levels of logs with decreasing levels of detail: **debug**, **trace**, **info0**, and **info1**.

<Warning>
  Each log level has a fixed size, and once it is full, the log is wiped and overwritten with new log messages. It is good practice to check these regularly while debugging.

# POST https\://run.vast.ai/get\_endpoint\_logs/

## Inputs

- One of the following:
  - `id`(int): ID of your endpoint
  - `endpoint`(string): Name of your endpoint
- `api_key`(string): The Vast API key associated with the account that controls the Endpoint.

```json JSON icon="js"
{
    "endpoint": "YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME",
    "api_key": "YOUR_VAST_API_KEY"
}
```

## Outputs

- `info0`: The contents of the `info0` log
- `info1`: The contents of the `info1` log
- `trace`: The contents of the `trace` log
- `debug`: The contents of the `debug` log

## Example: Fetching Endpoint Logs with cURL

```curl Curl icon="cube"
curl https://run.vast.ai/get_endpoint_logs/ \
-X POST \
-d '{"endpoint" : 123, "api_key" : "API_KEY_HERE"}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

***

# POST https\://run.vast.ai/get\_autogroup\_logs/

## Inputs

- `id`(int): The ID of the Worker Group
- `api_key`(string): The Vast API key associated with the account that controls the Worker Group.

```json JSON icon="js"
{
    "id": 1001,
    "api_key": "YOUR_VAST_API_KEY"
}
```

## Outputs

- `info0`: The contents of the `info0` log
- `info1`: The contents of the `info1` log
- `trace`: The contents of the `trace` log
- `debug`: The contents of the `debug` log

## Example: Fetching Worker Group Logs with cURL

```bash Bash
curl https://run.vast.ai/get_autogroup_logs/ \
-X POST \
-d '{"id" : 1001, "api_key" : "API_KEY_HERE"}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

<Warning>
  In some cases `info0` may not contain logs for a Worker Group.
