description: Learn how Vast.ai Serverless pricing works - GPU recruitment, endpoint suspension, and stopping.
---

Vast.ai Serverless offers pay-as-you-go pricing for all workloads at the same rates as Vast.ai's non-Serverless GPU instances. Each instance accrues cost on a per second basis.
This guide explains how pricing works.

## GPU Recruitment

As the Serverless engine takes requests, it will automatically scale its number of workers up or down depending on the incoming and forecasted demand. When scaling up, 
the engine searches over the Vast.ai marketplace for GPU instances that offer the best performance / price ratio. Once determined, the GPU instance(s) is recruited into 
the Serverless engine, and its cost ($/hr) is added to the running sum of all GPU instances running on your Serverless engine.&#x20;

As the request demand falls off, the engine will remove GPU instance(s) and your credit account immediatley stops being charged for those corresponding instance(s).

## Suspending an Endpoint

By suspending an Endpoint, the Endpoint will no longer recruit any new GPU instances, but will continue to use the instances it currently has. This is a way to cap the 
number of instances an Endpoint can manage, and therefore limit costs.&#x20;

## Stopping an Endpoint

Stopping an Endpoint will pause the recruitment of GPU instances, and put the existing instances into the "Stopped" state, preventing any work from being sent to 
the Endpoint group. The instances will still charge the small storage cost, but active rental and bandwidth costs will not be charged to the user account.&#x20;

## Billing by Instance State

The specific charges depend on the instance's state:

| State    | GPU compute | Storage | Bandwidth in | Bandwidth out |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Ready    | Billed      | Billed  | Billed       | Billed        |
| Loading  | Not billed  | Billed  | Billed       | Billed        |
| Inactive | Not billed  | Billed  | Billed       | Billed        |

GPU compute refers to the per-second GPU rental charges. See the [Billing Help](https://docs.vast.ai/billing#ugwiY) page for rate details.
